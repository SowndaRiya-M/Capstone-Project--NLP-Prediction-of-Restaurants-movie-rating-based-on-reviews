All of the items were delicious and the quantity for one plate is good enough for 3 ppl serving. The prawns were fresh and tasty . I loved the fried ice cream ( a must try if u visit this place) .

After asking manager that we have ordered main course more than half hour back, he told that you have ordered only 5 mins back. After this episode also it came after half an hour more.

      "We came in late but the place was still lively. On entering, you definitely notice the ambiance which is a bit idyllic and retro. With the 70s and the 80s song playing in the background, you definitely feel like going back in some time. \n",

      "\n",
      "Service was a bit slow but it could be understood as the meals were served hot. Though the place is small, it can comfortably sit a good amount of people with seating outside as well. Slightly on the pricier side, we still felt it was worth it given the quantity. With the trusted name of Karachi sweets as the backers, you can definitely count on the quality. \n",

      "We settled for an Irani Chai coupled with Mawa cake. While the tea was top notch, the cake was just about average. Service is very good.\n",

      "Overall, one of those places where ambience can pull you again and again\n",
      "Bad experience, first they denied zomato gold benefits by stating \"today is 15th aug\" so no offers. To be honest food was even more bad, paneer gravy was so watery n tasteless. Not recommended at all..............................\n",
      "Frio is set in a dark toned theme with black walls and complementing prismic mirrors with dim lighting to set mood for a quiet, interesting evening conversation.\n",
      "The music is contemporary and thankfully not too loud. It moulds into the environment without intruding into your private space.\n",
      "Service was fine. We had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us, but were courteous and friendly.\n",
      "Here is what we ordered:\n",
      "100% arabica cold coffee - basic and just right. Creamy and not too sugary.\n",
      "Dark chocolate shake - absolute yum and sinful. It tastes exactly as you would want it to. The only ask - since it's categorized as thickshake, it should be thicker, but I guess that's the case with shakes served anywhere in the city.\n",
      "Chicken ala plancha - Sheer dissapointment, especially given that it was in chef's special menu. It was as ordinary as ordinary can be. We ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs. It's basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning. Wouldn't recommend.\n",
      "Lamb ravioli - It's a shame we don't get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta. Even if they do, it's mostly vegetarian (spinach and ricotta cheese without exception). To our delight, Frio doesn't disappoint here. The ravioli is good (doesn't make it to my top 5 list), but still good. Ravioli was cooked well, herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy.\n",
      "We couldn't get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order (20 mins before closing), but I have heard that their tiramisu is great.\n",
      "All in all, Frio is a good place to visit. In terms of food, you could love or let's say not love the place basis what dish you ordered. I won't be a frequent here, but wouldn't mind going back for another try either. Happy dining!\n",
      "worst biriyani ever had. there was some small pieces of chicken curry (dry) placed over some rice. I don't know whether you have learnt atleast how biriyani looks like even after being in the city of biriyanis, that it is not just some pieces of chicken kept over a lump of basmati rice. pls grow up. (no 0* option)\n",
      "Food looked so yum!!! But sadly I could have only two morsels because then I realized that my \"pure\" veg fried rice and paneer had scrambled egg \"remains\" in it. Not one whole egg, so that I can at least remove it (I am not repulsed by egg, chicken would have been a different story, of course!) But this was bits and pieces mixed in the rice and gravy. No way to remove them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend this place to non vegetarians. Order veg and get non veg for the price of veg!\n",
      "\n",
      "Vegetarians beware!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have just added the initial pic with the big piece, the rest small pieces in the rice, I did not have the patience to click or pick.\n",
      "Never ordering from here ever again!\n",
      "I ordered 1 plate noodles & 1 plate Manchurian, from which Noodles taste was very bad. So I recommend that not order noodles from this restaurant.\n",
      "Have been to this place after hearing lot of good reviews, I can rate the food as very delicious,(specially pachimirchi Kodi Pulao) accurately spicy, varied dishes in the menu but I had a very bad day with respect to service.First of all there were hardly 2 waiters who were available and even though it was not crowded they were unable to address the customers and were confused with the menu as once they said bamboo chicken was not available and then when ordered some other starter came back with bamboo chicken secondly after some time those 2 waiters were missing and the whole floor was left without anyone to take care of guests. I hope that this is one of those cases and there wouldn't be other customers facing the same issue given the brand they own.\n",

      "Monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have GOT being screened then things get better. Yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of GOT. I had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. They are \"fancier than you are\". 😎😉🙂\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered for 🍅🍸 Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick 🙃😜🤪 in first sip itself. The 🍑 🍸 peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and 🍄 mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread 🍞 😋.\n",

      "It was good experience on my first visit. The staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. Overall I would like to rate it 4/5. You should definitely try this place for hangouts.\n",
      "Too much expensive for the quantity served. Not worth the money. Most items in the menu aren't available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taste is just average. Not recommended\n",
      "Need to improve a lot on ambience. Whether it’s Pathar ka ghost or any other mutton recipe, it’s simply very good. Servers are not very well trained but surely very polite. Pricing is what anyone just so look for.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Just ordered special desi chicken shawarma from this place and was the worst shawarma i had lately, very very less chicken filling and dull flavour. Not at all worth the price.\n",
      "Ya i Started with a starter what to say i ordered stuffed crab and its not spicy as i thought its not at all spicy adding pepper and salt gave more taste and its around 300 i guess and fish starter is also good and its spicy, yum and many pieces were given too.This hotel is famous for sea food.Thought its famous for sea food when i asked for lobster they could not able to provide and my suggestion is they can add more varities of sea food which are available in India too.I felt like limited edition of varities are a available here.then my tummy is full with 2starters and then came devils chocolate cake oh gosh its like a heaven for me and its around 280.This hotel gave a Goa touch they have buffet and everything and live music too.cocktails and mocktails are available too.The waiters were also dressed in the theme of beach and good place to take pictures also.\n",

      "Definitely a very popular bakery in hyderabad and for a good reason. Amazing cakes and brownies. It is one of those high end classy bakeries in town with a well established fan base who would vouch for it forever.\n",
      "My personal opinion is that it is a tad bit too hyped which has enabled them to slot their prices so high knowing that people would still buy them. I didn't like the fact that you have to purchase a box full of brownies or cupcakes and no less. Additionally the icing on the red velvet cupcake was way too sweet for people's taste. Brownies though are super soft and amazingly baked to perfection and so are their cakes.\n",
      "The ambience and food was amazing. Too mesmerized by the service provided to us by Tapan. Overall wonderful experience at this restaurant. Will recommend this to my friends.\n",
      "Pathetic customer service. We called and enquired if stag entry was allowed and they said yes. Once we reached here, stag entry was not entertained. When we told we had already called before coming, they said we will allow stag but not dance floor. Why the hell you can't clarify all your nonsense rules over call\n",
      "Had a great time in Mathura vilas, ambience is okayish.. Staff was friendly but server presented all the starters and main course at one go which was little weird and by that time food was cold.. ☹️\n",

      "Food: food was definitely good I liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts. They were pretty bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complaints: Starting with the ice cream guy- they have a cold stone ice cream. He broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream (technically just mixing it) and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away. Didn’t wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop. For all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second is also with the ice cream guy, we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately. Lost our appetite soon after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third is with one of the waiters, probably didn’t want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu. He agreed to get some but never showed up with it. I hope it’s his memory and nothing else that caused the problem.\n",

      "Such a pathetic experience I had in this place. \n",
      "First, I called them on their number to check if it is open at 6 PM on a Sunday. The person who received call on behave of Prism stated that it is open from 6 PM. Once we reach there by 6:30 PM, no staff was ready to respond and said who told you it is open now. The way they spoke to their customer is really annoying. \"I Don't know to whom you have called and taken the confirmation about the open hours but, as you came early I am considering you and giving a table\". Is this how low they treat a customer? \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, When requested for a good seat as there is no crowd available. The manager or a person with attitude told us \"No, there are no seats available\"(In a bold manner). When I checked from Zomato there are plenty of tables available. I got pinched with irritation. Though, I felt the lighting is good and order for drinks to my friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Me and my friends were feeling uncomfortable with the way people treating their customer. And then, mosquitoes came into picture. There are full of mosquitoes hissing around our heads and of course no AC has turned ON. Out of frustration, we tried cancelling the food that was ordered by us and everything we ordered. They said, it is not possible to cancel the order and your order will be here in 20 minutes. I was like \"WTF\". I asked for cheque and paid the bill without having anything and left the place. Such a disappointing experience it was. I suggest do not visit this place where customers are not treated well.\n",
      "Somewhere i feel like this n shah competes with each other, one triesto deliver the best carrying both quality and quantity. Seems like they ain't running for money but to feed us hahahaha...!!\n",

      "Had a great team dinner at 3bs gochibowli with my friend. And mainly service by gobind bro. He is very polite and humbel. All things are really very nice.\n",
      "A complete and absolute disaster. The place where we sat was dirty. There were cracks on the walls. We ordered the food to be less spicy but I guess they cook how they want to cook. The AC was non-existent. It felt like we were sitting in a tandoor. The service was pretty slow.  If you bring food you bring the starters together and then you don't put a gap in between the starters and the main course. The taste was appalling, sub-par service, being in one of the prime locations. I have ordered a lot of times from Kritunga Madhapur and that one is very good. I think Kritunga Gachibowli has a long way to go before it becomes worth the money. Wish them the best\n",

In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.\n",

      "Quality of food is really great. Ingredients are top of the line which give a great product. A must visit. Service is equally great. Our food took some time but it was worth the wait. ( The restaurant was busy with the Sunday Brunch and probably alacarte orders need equal attention)\n",
      "nice\n",
      "BDubs continues to be on top in the race of Buffalo fried chicken. The pizzas, burgers, desserts are equally good. The service is friendly and fast. The ambience is amazing and private.

      "What ever the item I consumed are very tasty. Like paneerbutter masala, aloo paratha, paneer kulhca, samosa ragada, chole batura. Not enough place, packed with people, still delivering the orders in time is good. Overall you can visit this place.\n",
      "This is one of party hubs of Hyderabad. Initially somehow I didn't like it but after 2 or 3 visits the place grew on me. We now frequent the place for the mahol of the place. Ambience is pretty cool and nice crowd as well.\n",
      "Well this is the first time I ordered from NorFest - The Dhaba. I ordered for mutton combo meal which contains rice, dal makhani, 2 paratha and mutton with a pocket pinch of Rs. 400. However, very disappointed with the quantity of food. At that price range they are not providing a proper portion . Moreover the mutton was well cooked but out of 4 small pieces, 2 of them had bones and no meat . Kindly donot deceive your customers like this with good packaging . I gave three star only for the quality .\n",
      "So as part of this food tasting festival, I was sent a royal Navratri meal that had paneer makhanwala, singhada aloo paratha, hare tamatar ki sabzi and saabudana vada. It’s an absolute delight for someone who’s fasting during Navratri. Each and every dish was just yum! Even if you’re not fasting you should try this. Slightly overpriced but it’s worth trying. The paneer and paratha were the best part of the thali.\n",
      "Worst thing I got 4 dinner, I ordered Full grill it was not all grilled unable to eat also Full like a flesh the worst grill in my life I hate\n",
      "The place refused to replace quarter plate. The service is pathetic. Food is on table but no spoons or forks. The manager has one answer they are playing by rule book\n",

      "Super fast delivery\n",
      "Was here on a Saturday night for my dad's birthday. A wonderful place to spend an evening with your family and loved ones. The ambiance is calm and perfect. The staff is very helpful and understanding and will help you with anything you ask them for. The place is managed by Nithin and his courtesy and nature of serving the customer is just worth to note. Had a wonderful time, cheers.\n",
      "I ordered their Special Chicken Shawarma from Zomato. First look it was quite heavy for one shawarma. The quantity is huge but coming to cons which is a quality.It is not at all good. The chicken was hard and unnecessarily they made it too spicy also. It usually stays open late night but don't order from here still.The quality needs to improve a lot.\n",

Fried rice was disgusting because it was like made from rice of last night and it was not good to eat. Coming to Manchurian i will say it was a average Manchurian and not that good.\n",
      "This used to be a good place, the service level now is pathetic. They won’t even offer you the menu unless you ask for it, if a dish is served in a bad state it will take ages for you to give the feedback and by the time it is changed your meal would be over and the check ofcourse will take atleast 15 mins to get to you...so plan wisely at Lol Lol land\n",

      "Best place Ever Jonathan's Kitchen\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are near Gachibowli and are planning to have a perfect lunch or dinner so I recommend you the best place is Jonathan's kitchen, where you can visit with your family and friends. I really loved this place from it’s ambiance to food and service, everything’s top notch.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Wednesday night and we were near Gachibowli and really hungry, when I suggested we will visit Jonathan's Kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. I was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters Grilled Pomfret, Chili chicken , Crispy Corn , Chicken Wings, Nawabi shikampuri kebab, Dragon prawns and Tiger prawns. All of the starters were the best, I have never tried such before anywhere. Now that the starting was the best, I promise at the end it will be a blast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. It was so good! Chili chicken wasn’t much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. Crispy corn I have tried at many restaurants and I loved Flechazo’s before, but now I can say the best crispy corn is at Jonathan's kitchen. I think this is the best compliment. Chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then my favorite part were the prawns. Here we tried 3 different types of prawns, Butter Garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, Dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, Mr. Tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. It is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, Tiger prawns; these were too large in size, I have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we ordered some mocktails because it’s mandatory; Orange delight ,Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada ,Black current, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. Every mocktail has their own specialty. Orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. Black current is really good in taste and refreshing. Spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. Every mocktail is best at Jonathan's kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it’s time for main course, in that we ordered Dal Tadka and Rara Gosht with Butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha, and Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. Every dish just left us speechless! Dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at Jonathan's kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without dessert, I never end my dinner. So here we ordered Gulab jamun, Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and Cream brulee with Fresh fruits. All the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.\n",
      "\n",

      "Have visited this place couple of times and as always their service is great and very quick. Specially their staff is very friendly and caring. Their vast buffet menu will give taste of different cuisine. Visited today for my anniversary with my parent. The service by Mr Dharma made it even great experience for them as he served their requested order very swiftly and they enjoyed the evening. Their live counter was something I loved the most. May be adding some options for veg in starter can make it better for veg folks :)\n",
      "Well you know what they are famous for - Karachi Biscuits. But there is a whole range of stuff to eat at their outlet. There is mini pizzas, fries, Puffs (4/5), Paninis (4/5) and sandwiches. Ofcourse there is a whole range of biscuits, dry fruits and cakes to chose from as well. You wont come out without buying anything. Trust me on this. Have fun at Karachi Bakery. Cheers!\n",
      "Loved this bakery for its amazing variety of biscuits cookies n variety of pastry plus there tit bits. U would have to be there to understand what this place is all'about. USP of the chain is its reasonable pricing. So affordable that I was surprised that how we are paying so much in Bangalore in any decent bakery. must visit in case u r in Hyderabad.\n",

Pizza was good, so were the other titbits but what I liked most was there service, took time to place the order at the POS but the bartender whipped up my drink in no second bad I never had to call out for a repeat, it was ready each time. Overall I go to this place every other week one of the best party place around.\n",
      "Very unprofessional and arrogant staff.\n",
      "It takes 30mins to take order 🙄\n",
      "Staff is so careless towards customer. Ambience also not that much great. It's a chillar pub. Not recommend for couples.\n",
      "Crowd is tooomuch because it's they allow stags aswell if you show your office id.\n",
      "It's a budget friendly.\n",
      "Bad service I have not received the order but I got a mail that you have enjoyed the meal. Irritating service from zomato . Not support team and pick up delivery boy called for delivery\n",
      "Went with team for lunch over there...first proper parking is not there....resto is quiet small with very limited options in veg and non veg.... ambience, starters, veg non veg main course everything is just avg... everything is just dull and avg...I mean neither food is spicy or tasty ...it just avg and dull...\n",
      "One of Hyderabad's most stylish fine dining places, Jonathan's Kitchen serves lip-smacking culinary delights paired up with a cool and extensive bar menu. The luxurious ambiance and enchanting music make this place an ensemble of various occasions. I was here for a Tuesday night dinner with some friends and we experienced a flavorful time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with some amazing starters; Butter Garlic Prawns, Grilled Pomfret, Dragon Prawns, Crispy Corn Pepper Salt, Chicken Wonton and Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab. The Prawns were just fabulous, they were a perfect start to our dinner. Grilled Pomfret was also very good. Crispy Corn were the best that I've ever had, they've topped my last best opinion. Chicken Wonton had a perfect crisp covering and the filling was really great. Lastly, the Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab were very juicy and succulent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next we had some of the finest mocktails; Orange delight, Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada, Black currant, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. All of these were very refreshing and perfect to have before moving onto the main course, while still enjoying the appetizers. Although Virgin Pina Colada wasn't that great, and Orange Delight the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had an array of dishes from the main course, starting off with the ambrosial Chateaubriand, tenderloin cooked medium rare and served with creamy spinach and mushroom cream. It is a high end dish, and it did keep it's name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we savored Rara Gosht and Dal Tadka curries with Butter Naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Both curries were absolutely delectable and were a divine treat to our taste buds. Lastly, we had Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. This was an absolute favourite of all, a tempting and toothsome Chinese dish with succulent chicken crispy on the outside juicy inside, slathered with a hot sweet uniquely spicy and sticky Indo Chinese schezwan sauce that just made our night.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ended our dinner with the most sumptuous desserts; a classic Gulab Jamun, a fruity Creme Brulee, and a luscious Chocolate Fondant Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. A perfect end to an amazing dinner. We had a wonderful time here and are just waiting to visit again.\n",
      "Hands down the best Beer in Town 🍺love their cherry beer.\n",

They were running some promotion for cool berg drinks tried there mint flavor and it was horrible\n",

      "It was a good experience. Could improve on the quality of the starters! The prawns were amazing and the main course was good too. Could’ve been better if they changed the menu of the desserts\n",
      "Not a great dinner I had in the last night, ordered tikka biryani ànd dum Biryani . Less masala and quality is bit of low. Ambience was okay\n",
      "Overthemoon is extremely lively place with great music and tasty food. Ambience is quiet spacious. They have wide range of their own brewed beers.\n",
      "At the beginning I was disappointed with services but they made it up with their top services.\n",
      "A very decent place to hangout with your friends for some quality of time.\n",
      "Rating - (4.5/5)\n",
      "Except for service and the starters to some extent nothing was good at this place we tried the buffet and after starters nothing was worth eating and I successfully wasted Rs.649 .I hope they improve it when I visit the next time.\n",
      "Great place, all the food I've tried is great. They serve great shrimp and pizza. Ambiance is also really nice. Fun place to go with friends\n",
      "A very bad experience. I went here with my team, but the staff made sure that we had the worst experience. The food was cold, served very late. Drinks were of bad quality. Staff behavior was also very bad.\n",
      "Nice ambiance. We had guthivankaya pulao and it’s like kind of ok not so great . Pocket friendly .They have different items in menu but taste wise can be little more better\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city.\n",
      "A good place with a calm ambience and a lot of pots.\n",
      "We went in for the À la carte. The service was a bit slow, they need to speed up on that. We ordered crispy baby corn. Usually not a fan of corn, but loved this one. Also, the masala papad was a good one. We went ahead with the main course. The kadai paneer and rumali roti were good. Would give it a 3.5/5.\n",
      "Overall, a place with a different theme and calm ambience. This place is worth a visit and is also economical.\n",
      "(Top pick : Crispy Baby Corn)\n",
      "I visited the place yesterday for lunch with my family. This is usually a most loved place by all my family members and me for a casual dining. But yesterday it is a very bad experience we noticed the manger is changed. It took 20 minutes to find some one to take the order. Then it took him almost 30 minutes for the thali. I called the manager and asked why is it taking so long as we habe only asked a thali and lassi. Then he told us that some of the food got over so we are preparing it again so only it is taking so much time. But is was courtesy that he could have informed us that it is going to take time. After 40 minutes the food was served. But the lassi again took a very long time we cancelled the order and moved out.\n",
      "I paid additional amount to add chiken to the pasta but the pasta that came had nothing.\n",
      "Have been here once. The staff was courteous and very friendly. Overall the theme was perfect and sets the Arabic mood. I think they can work a bit more on offering more choices, felt that the choices were limited apart from the mandi it is known for. Limited veg options too.\n",
      "Santosh was a great host. Spot on service and exceptional taste. Truly relished all the dishes we ordered. Awesome experience. Worth the money\n",
      "I placed an order for Special Chicken Biryani. The taste and the presentation of food is good. The chicken pieces are so delicious and the rice is so good.\n",
      "good timing\n",
      "chicken is not cooked well. taste is also not good\n",
      "Went on a sat noon. Food is ok type, not that tasty, mayonese is sweet (-_-| wtf ????) , mutton is not tasty. Chicken starter was crispy ( reason for 2 *) . I didn't like the desert also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict : Not recommend, skip.\n",
      "I have been ordering from this place for a long time. They are fantastic in terms of following any specific instructions you might have when you order via Swiggy or UberEats. The food is as described, there is no overdose of spices or oil. The menu is varied. I have tried Chinese and Tandoori dishes from here, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. This is my first choice when we want to dine in. My favourite dishes from here are Chicken Lababdaar, Kafuli and Chicken Afghani.\n",

      "I took away one star from the review as there are rare issues with quality control, like tandoori kababs were once a little burnt.\n",

      "This restaurant deserves a special mention for their superbly amazing Keema Pav!! I usually do not eat mutton dishes in restaurants (I prefer home-made), but the Keema Pav served here reminded me of home - it's that good! We had even ordered for Baida Roti - which was again too good and had a very interesting take to it. (By the way, their servings are quite big compared to what they charge you for!) Suleimaani Chaai also deserves a special mention, it was so good that we ordered it twice.\n",

The staff doesn't know a thing about service. Tables are unclean and stick! As usual the stupid DJ is Soo loud but it got better later. Poor maintainince of the place adds to everything. I literally had to go and shout to have someone take my order. Waiter is so absent minded. Imagine not even getting a glass of water for 40mins.\n",
      "The poor manager had to wait tables and supply cutlery to the required people. Some waiters were just standing there and enjoying music as if they own the place. There was this one particular guy who was soo arrogant that he started back talking and arguing. It was a really pathetic experience and I would definitely choose a different place next time.\n",

The chicken wings were a little sweet and not that great if you want to have some spicy good to go with your drinks. The only thing I liked about the place was that it stocked Kalhua which was out of stock at almost all other places. The seating could be arranged better, seats weren't that comfortable and I keep hurting my knees Everytime I make a move. The music/DJ was exceptionally loud and not pleasant at all ! If you can please get the DJ to reduce the volume at least during peak dinner hours, I couldn't hear anything my colleagues sitting across the table were speaking!\n",

The initial order of a different kebab was sent back as the chef didn't comply with our little/no spice request. Our order of Aloo Parantha and Veg Kolhapuri came as requested, however the Ajwain Laccha Parantha and Roti came laced with butter/ghee. The bread was replaced in 5 min or so as requested. Aloo Parantha Combo came along with raita and chole. We requested raita to be replaced with another serving of chole, and the staff gladly obliged.\n",

By no means it seemed to be mandi rice. It was more like Pulao rice. Considering the price that I paid the quality was no match for it. Mandi rice is never sticky but in this case it was. Kindly look into the image and you will understand.\n",

Inspite of bill crossing 10k extremely reluctant to leave ice bucket on table. Asked for French fries without chillies twice but no help still after so much time fresh fries are not in. Ok last one came finally when THE MANAGER arrived after being aggressive. They want to offer free drinks but it’s not about money but experience, will share great review next time if we get one as we promised the manager to come back.\n",

The food is over priced and the quantity they give us is way too less. We ordered the lamb lasagna and we literally had ONE piece of lasagna which really shocked me. Then we had the chicken steak which was decent - nothing special. We gave up on their main courses so went straight to desserts. We ordered the warm apple pie, cheesecake, and the Brazilian chocolate cremeux. The chocolate dessert tasted old, the cheesecake was a thin slice of sadness, but the warm apple pie was very good. Overall, never coming here again and don't recommend to anyone\n",

I felt all the items on the plate were dry items be it the grilled vegetables or the Patty or The Pulao Rice, there should’ve been some kind of gravy or dip with these items or else the dish tasted good. We had also ordered for a Spaghetti Aglio Olio. So the Spaghetti that they serve here is wheat spaghetti we didn’t really like how it tasted. When we informed the management about the Spaghetti, they immediately changed it with Spinach Ravioli. The Ravioli tasted really nice, the rich garlic flavour of this dish with pine nuts was a perfect blend.\n",

      "Gautam's service is very good\n",
      "A small place with with dim lighting and gives the feel of romantic dinner table. At first we thought it's a good budget friendly restaurant for Chinese food in gachibowli. Food tasted good and so was the presentation. we were enjoying our food and suddenly we heard people arguing with Waiter over something. And to our horror when we find out they had found cockroach in their food our experience turned into nightmare. They should maintance the hygiene of their kitchen.\n",
      "We are very satisfied with the food and the service was excellent. \"We want our customers to be fully Satisfied\" said the chef and he meant it.\n",

      "average very less piece's\n",
      "If there was an option of putting up 0 stars, I wouldn't have hesitated. Look at the kind of food they offer. I had ordered this 'Aloo Kulcha Combo' from this restaurant. A burnt kulcha, and not even a bowlful of Dal was served. The combo mentioned pickle as well, but that wasn't sent either. Despite complaining them with requisite proofs, no action was taken. TERRIBLE!\n",

      "This place was recommended by a local friend after learning that I do not favor spicy biriyani. And I was thinking about trying hyderabadi biryani once again before I leave. Yes pista house lived up the expectation. Good packaging, prompt delivery, good taste..\n",
      "Qutub Yasin - It was really an awesome experience with these guys. He was really friendly and we had a very good conversation him. I will come back hungry for more.\n",
      "Visited the place on a Saturday ! We had reservations made for 8pm and reached at around 8:20pm, only to receive a disapproving look by the lady and were told that it is difficult to hold a table this long! The entrance gave a deserted look and we were thinking why is this female so arrogant. Thereafter we got to know the real story as we moved towards the seating area. The place was well lit, with a posh ambience, perfect seating and tranquil yet charming environment. Really loved the idea of the hanging plants amidst the lights.\n",
      "We ordered Lotus stem galauti kebab, kung paw chicken, teriyaki mushroom. The starters were delicious especially the chicken. Beware of the cocktail as you might be in for some surprises.\n",
      "Ordered stir fried udon Noodles for main course. Although a bit oily, it was tasty, full of vegetables ! The dark brownie ordered as desert was mouth watering, the taste lingers.\n",

      "All in all a good experience !\n",
      "This place has decent ambience.m and good variety of food. They also have a great variety in dessert. Food is good and the best part is the location which is close to the tech space.\n",
      "This is an amazing place to hang out with your friends for a coffee.. their breads are amazing as they bake fresh everyday... I have a big craving for their Spinach Corn and Cheese toast and also for their cinnamon bomb... their donuts are really good specially the salted nuttela and the Elvis donuts.... don’t ever miss their Chennai filter coffee, over all a great place and very customer friendly.. just a small let down compared to their Chennai outlets they lack few items hopefully they get back the way how it is in Chennai... a must go place in Hyderabad..\n",
      "Pathetic!!! A group of 20 people from work visited this place, we didn't have great expectations, at the same time we didn't foresee a terrible experience that it eventually would turn out to be. Half of us were seated close to the glass facing the Gachibowli road, thanks to their incredible maintenance, the ac was so poor, we were all sweating profusely. We weren't served starters for atleast 40 minutes. The choice of plates and their maintenance is extremely poor to say the least. The food (starters, main course, desserts) tasted so bad that most of us were content just eating curd and ice cream. We will never be going back to this place.\n",
      "Nice place for traditional wings.....They are having different sauces....Sunny helped us with tasting and choosing the sauce, and nice service\n",

      "As the name goes it is actually a Feast to have. Starting with the food, they have a lot of variety and everything is worth tasting at least. The variety of salads is different and delicious. The main course is really good and specially the Dal Makhani. And all my rating goes to the desserts. They are plenty and you can’t get over each and every item. Definitely a place to over eat .\n",
      "This place serves buffet for lunch..It is a value for money dine restaurant.Although they claim to be a Mediterranean resto,most of the items served were that of Indian..So , don't go by its name.The service is really good and the chef personally asks your preference and feedback. The complimentary starter can be improved..One thing I liked here is the option for vegetarians.Veg starters were plenty ,be it be live counter or the ones served at table.Cajun potato,corn , pineapple,paneer ,kebab are to name a few.All were good.They serve MOMO ,pasta,pizza too in the counters.\n",
      "Main course was nice too and had good variety of curries.\n",
      "Dessert spread was huge . Overall ,a good place.Hope they maintain the same variety at the same cost.\n",
      "Excellent service by Bahamas and Reheat... Quality of service is also excellent... Hospitality is marvelous and also the ambience, deserts and choose your bird sections are great.\n",
      "Ordered paneer butter masala and naans.The curry had lot of food color and oil which is ok.But two naans weren't even equal to one naan in general...they were way too small\n",
      "Nice place to hang out casually. Wide selection of sauces and wing selection.\n",
      "Syed, who waited our table was really nice and helpful.\n",
      "Worth going to at least once.\n",
      "This place was in my bucket list since a very long time and my visit to this place is very random. I really liked the traditional ambience. The decor of the place is good. The service was very slow and the staff i felt were little confused.\n",
      "So, pot pourri please look into that.\n",
      "And about the food, we ordered Chilli egg, Pandumirchi royyala vepudu, Mamsam pulao, Nellore chepala pulusu with Tandoori naan. The quantity of the food was really good and the food was not different from home food.\n",
      "Food is cold.. N not even tasty\n",
      "Thank you so much for the excellent food.it tasted great. Price quality everything good. I ordered via zomato online app. Delivery package was also great.if there was a way if packaging more environment friendly that would be great\n",

      "Amazing ambience with amazing spicy chicken table and chicken 65 which is must try.Amazing food with amazing ambience.Really enjoyed a lot with friends and company\n",
      "Best north indian food in town. The flavours were very well seasoned and we were very much satisfied with the reasonable pricing as well. Ordered naans and combos and it was given in fair quantity in relation to the prices. Would love to go again.\n",
      "Good food!\n",
      "Bakery items in the bread section are tasty. Croissants, bagels etc. Muffins are dense in texture and the icing is overly sweet. Definitely can improve on those. Not recommended for strong coffee seekers. If you want coffee coloured sweet milk beverages, then you can give it a try.\n",
      "mast\n",
      "Over the moon... Name is not matching with ambience. There is no roof top seating for this brewery. Outside seating was just average, atleast the same ambience can be in the second are third floor. Service was very quick and fast. Because there is no other brewery in surroundings we can visit to this place.\n",
      "Super\n",
      "We booked for 40 people for an office party and it was a complete chaos. Some south indian festival was going on in the restaurant, so the expectations were little high but a complete let down. Firstly, they had not planned properly to manage 40 plus people. Some people who arrived first got the privilege of getting welcome drink and I arrived 10 mins late, and simply didn't get it. For starters also, some privileged ones got served with only few of the varieties as per the menu. Our of frustration, people started with main course and in between starters were being served. What a big mess it was. The complete team of 40 was disappointed.\n",
      "Was too spicy\n",

      "Ambience is good and staff is very polite. Best place for a family outing\n",
      "Had very high expectations from this place given the great reviews it has got. However, in my opinion it is just over-hyped! Not so great. If you have been to any Theobroma outlet in Mumbai, you will realize how this place is full of shit. The brownies are very average. Tea loaf is worse. One word - Underwhelming.\n",

      "Overall worth a try\n",
      "Natural maggi taste is missing, please don't add additional masala\n",
      "Went for lunch with friends...ala carte. Liked the ambience,though it was really far to get to!! We had the Caesar salad, which was fresh and could have used a bit more seasoning; Pizza arabiata-really nice, crust thin and ingredients fresh and tasty! Penne pasta-chicken was also good, though the chicken seemed dry. The best dish was Thai green curry vegetables which was served with a jasmine rice-the best ever flavours-a must try!! Now coming to the desserts- we had the philadelphia cheese cake baked-nice plating but cheesecake can be improved significantly. Creme brule was good--loved the crispy carmelized sugar crust.\n",
      "There was a lot of crowd and it took us a long time to get our orders. Overall it was a nice experience, hope to have a better one next time.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Visited this place today. Food is no doubt good but the service is awful. We had to wait more than 30 minutes for the food to be served, that too when we asked then they served. The staff was rude as well. Had to ask for every little thing. Even the basic services were very bad. Would suggest the owner to improve the staff and services.\n",

      "I have placed order for Mutton Haleem Special - 3 Qty and Biryani Rice - 1 Qty. Shah Ghouse and Zomoto together delivered shortage of Mutton Haleem Special - 1 Qty, informed to deliver executive while collecting parcel and reportes to Zomoto support. Zomoto team said that no response from Shah Ghouse regarding shortage delivery. Finall Zomoto also not confirmed anything and accepted refund only missed item value. Packing also very unhygienic. Totally upset with Shah Ghouse and Zomoto.\n",
      "Very good place but we need to wait so long for the food to deliver us they serve the customers very good response,we had murgh malai kabab and muuton briyani with our office colleagues very good in taste I like the grren chutney which they serve with malai kabab 🤩😛\n",
      "Completely disappointed. The staff was clearly reluctant to work.\n",
      "The food was mediocre at best. We ordered sweet and sour chicken soup, chilli chicken , hakka noodles and all flavored chicken. Only the soup was lukewarm, everything else was cold. Nothing was made fresh.\n",
      "We had to complaint to the manager about the same, who agreed with us but did nothing anyway. So we walked out without completing the lunch.\n",

      "Ordered Mango Moon. The taste should have been proportional. It felt more like yoghurt and less mango.\n",
      "It’s a problem with any Avanlanche base shake from Tempteys. Otherwise Gelato base shakes have always been good.\n",

      "Got a chance to review their Navratri special menu and chose their royal navratri meal which came in a neat packaging with Singhada ke aloo parantha,paneer makhanwala,sabudhana ki kheer,green tomato curry and curd. Best part was paneer makhanwala , it was perfect and exactly with no onions and garlic suitable for Navratri and then the rare and filling part was paratha 🎉 The meal is completely fills your stomach after a whole day of fasting! I rated it 4 because of spilling of oil and tomato which is a bit half cooked else everything was perfectly enroute deli ♥️\n",

      "A great place to hang out with your friends . One of the best pubs in the city . It’s a little highly priced but overall the ambience, music and food matches the bar. Great food and great music . Courteous staff and great service.\n",
      "Great taste, Nice quality, Affordable prices, Effective varities, plus Zomato on time delivery. I order here almost daily. Only problem with this place is Caution : you will get addicted for sure.\n",
      "The waiters were very rude that the hotel is very busy...if you ask for starters and soups they say it will late order biryani🤨🤨...Inam shocked with their behaviour with customers\n",
      "The place and ambience was good.Only sour point was our waiter Kundan who told us to change places as soon as we were seated (maybe to accommodate his regular guests who tip him well).I had Zomato gold membership and showed him the same.Instead of taking a photo of the same,he started surfing the phone. When I objected,he denied checking the phone. Though the food and place was good,the waiter spoiled the mood just with his creepy attitude, which cost the two stars.\n",
      "This is one of the best cafes around in the area with a wide variety of options on the menu. Singaporean chilli prawn and keema pav here are the always opt of in doubt! The ambience is also pretty cool and the service is impressive. A must visit place for hanging out.\n",
      "Been there for my friend's birthday. The non veg buffet was good . They have lot of varieties in veg, nog veg starters. I'll suggest this place to my friends for any celebration.\n",

      "Never go for this\n",
      "This restaurant was too good in serving food - both quantity and quality wise. All the items we ordered were worth for money specially in terms of quantity. Ambience was good. We had starters -lemon and coriander chicken and haryali fish Tikka. Main course, chicken biryani and schezwan egg fried rice were our choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got 2 of them as complimentary with GOLD.\n",
      "starters were amazing - especially, fish was juicy with smoky flavor. Quantities of both chicken biryani full and fried rice was huge. Biryani can easily serve 3 for main course. Service was extra ordinary. Totally worth the GOLD visit. Looking forward to try other dishes here :)\n",
      "one of the best achari mutton. soft and properly marinated meat. the spices were properly grinded and cooked. the aroma of the food was so mesmerising that after a point we forgot to click the pics. zafrani mutton biryani here is a must for all the connoisseurs of good food. while other biryani joints also pretty good, but Pista House has a distinct place in Hyderabadi food map. the sitafal sweet suggest by our captain was awesome. staff was good especially Shahrukh with his distinct serving style. also bone soup is a must try.\n",
      "I and my friend went here to watch the IPL live screening and have some good time. One good thing was that they have 2+2 on drinks through Zomato gold. The food pretty decent too, but what I didn't like was that it didn't have good options in drinks, especially non-alcoholic. We eventually went for Masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad. We asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn't take it back. Wasn't happy with the service.\n",

      "Cool place to party with friends &family, good choice of sizzlers available, juice & smoothies also available, little more care will make them perfect, suggesting to place cabage leaves over sizzler plate to avoid colour change of lower level food, wash room at inconvenient place, found lot of delivery boys near counter.\n",

      "Budget: 3/5\n",
      "This Place has only take aways, so I have ordered Red velvet Creme Cheese cake, and the Cake taste is lip smacking and everyone liked it. We even took a box of fresh brownies which are awfully tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only lacking thing is this place doesn't support customization of cakes. Prices are a bit high but they are worth it as the taste is good.\n",
      "Bunch of hypocrites. One cannot enter unless they have a girl beside them. One cannot enter unless they have shoes tied to their feet. One cannot enter unless their lower limbs are fully covered (for guys). We pay you to get us drunk,not to judge us based on our footwear and whom we tag along. You think someone without shoes can't behave or pay you the bill? Pathetic stereotypes.\n",
      "Great taste and always have been consistent with the quality of the food been served. Zomato Gold members can enjoy 1+1 and its worth it for the price you pay and the quality of food they serve.\n",
      "I love the food here they have a great spread for their buffet. However I have never had the buffet so I wouldn’t comment on the taste, but the spread is definitely good cz I checked that out. I come here and order right out of the menu and over time have fallen in love with their Fish items from the grill section. I have had the Blackened salmon steak, Cilantro Fish and the Murrel Crust and have loved each one. However, if I had to pick one it would be the Salmon and that too would win by a very close margin. Apart from their fish I love their Spring Chicken and Chicken Confit as well. If you love grilled meat that is cooked delicately in continental cooking style, then this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the ambiance, it’s minimalistic and chic. The staff is polite and warm. They have a Zomato gold offer on food, so that’s amazing because the food is a little on the pricier side. I definitely plan to have their buffet soon and will update this post accordingly.\n",
      "Delicious and timely delivery! Dont miss the roomali shawarmas! Im on a business trip to hyderabad and this shawarma kept me company while I worked into the night.\n",
      "Ordered the paneer wraps, one with the cheese, and other with a tangy masala. N a paneer rice bowl too. Paneer treat to myself. The wraps were perfectly made, with the covering prepared well, and the stuffing was mixed well with the right amount of sauces and cheese, giving a juiciness to the wrap. The rice bowl was equally yummy. With rice being cooked well, fragrant with exotic herbs and spices giving a deep ochre n shades of olive green look to the dish. Overall a nice place to order from n worth the money. Recommended 😊\n",
      "The quality of food and drink was really good. What turned out to be the biggest let-down was the service. A few of the waiters are really ignorant. They look for bigger groups to serve and circle around them only. With much effort we got a waiter to come and take our order. After waiting for half an hour, we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all. We got a new waiter to whom we had to re-iterate the whole thing. Although the new waiter was really polite and helpful, but our experience was already ruined. So my humble request is, if you don't like to serve a smaller group, mention it outside and we will definitely avoid your restaurant.\n",
      "Ordered butter naan.. Completely jalgayaaa and very very difficult to chew and eat.. Not at all goood...Panner makhani is also not al good..\n",
      "I ordered garlic bread and cheesy fries with lots of hope since it had a 4.0 rating in zomato but sadly it disappointed me to the core , the garlic bread was as small as good day biscuits and very hard to bite while the cheesy fries were very cold and not at all consumable!\n",

      "Have been here many times. I was a frequent at their madhapur branch since 2006. Its a quiet place and family friendly. The lift is old, dark and horrible. It feels it will breakdown, except that it doesn't. They tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one. Coming to the food. Its just okay. Nothing outstanding or too bad. Starters and Chicken items are usually good enough. Their tandoori chicken doesn't have breast portion. I couldn't understand the rationale behind it, its just leg, thigh and wings. And yes I don't know why they have downgraded their crockery. They serve curries in smaller household type steel bowls.\n",
      "rava dosa was little hard\n",
      "Everything is Punjabi about this place. Be it food, music or ambience. The food would satisfy a palate craving the taste of the dhabas of Punjab. Makki ki roti te sarson ka saag and daal makhani are a must try!\n",

I ordered vegetable cheese Maggie and it came on time and was packed in a white box like you see in a picture.packaging is ok, the spoon was poor quality, could have been stronger to hold the Maggie.The moment I open the box, people around me could smell it and it was great, looks cheesy and yummm. So was the taste, it was good, never dissapoints. Price is nominal as well which is around 50 -70 bucks for various varieties they serve. Deserves a 4.5. I haven't tried the Momo's yet, will add to the review once I try them.\n",

      "Though the prices are in a bit higher end, but thats something you can expect from a brand like URBAN ASIA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now talking about the food, the varieties offered in both veg and nonveg is quite good and delicious. They take there their time to get the food, but thats because they cook it hot right after the order is placed.\n",

      "Been to this place after looking at the ratings. We had a mushroom Moti tikka for starter which tasted sweet and we could barely finish the starter due to its sweetness.

A group of six food enthusiasts promptly ordered six diverse mocktails namely Sparking blue, Mango lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemons, Virgin mojito, Masala cola. Out of all the mocktails, Masala cola and mango Lassi stood out and were the best. The other mocktails were equally good and refreshing.\n",

Overall a great experience!\n",
      "One line #Only4chicken 😜, Ambience is good with large screen inside and nice atmosphere outside. Coming to food you will not find any item other than Chicken for Non veg and Aloo for Veg 😂.

      "I went on a 10th of February 2019 and they were celebrating Avengers then. People in Thor & Captain America costumes with desserts all being prepared according to the theme gave us a cheerful theme to feast on. The wide spread of the food with varied cuisines and live music just made my day. Chat corner serving Pani Puri and various types of chats, Fish Poppers, Spaghetti, Biryani, Tikkas, Naan, Roti, Chicken curry and a long list of sumptuousness makes me go again. \n",
      "Frills: So on that specific day, there was a photographer who clicked everyone with the superheros and gave us a print of the same, which was such a delight.\n",

      "The place is little small and can accommodate maximum of 50-60 people during full house.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have their own brewery with many variants in beer. The food quality is very good for both veg and non-veg options.\n",
      "We like to explore all places which serve good nonveg food and seeing the reviews on zomato, decided to try this restaurant near dlf in gachibowli. Overall experience was ok and nothing great. They have a big dinning area. We ordered marsala special chicken gravy and roti. Which was with an omelette on top. The taste wasn't something special and we could not get the proper flavour of this gravy. Basa fish tikka was not as soft as we get it elsewhere. Usually it melts in mouth and is super soft and tasty but we were disappointed here.\n",
      "My go to ice cream was death by chocolate until my taste buds got addicted to the hunny bunny sundae.\n",

      "worth the money\n",

      "The whole place was vibrating because of the loud music from the club above, completely spoiled the ambiance. The food wasn’t great either. The atta rumali roti was kachcha. Butter chicken lacked proper thickness. The biryani at jubilee is way way way better. Wouldn’t visit again. Especially when there’s a better alternative in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was very good. No complains about the service. Very well trained staff.\n",

      "Great ambience and the staff was very responsive and friendly (sittu , santunu and badal). A must visit place for food lovers. If u are looking for buffet, this is the best place to try it.\n",
      "Had ordered veg pulao & rajma, it didn't seem fresh .. however I consumed it & couldn't sleep whole night because of vommiting & loose motion.\n",

      "it is one of the best in gachibowli. it is value for money. the best item i liked is Veg.Biryani and Sambar Rice. I always love to party there.\n",
      "damn too much oil, I can make another curry out of it, that much\n",
      "we are not satisfied, with the quantity of chicken piece which you given, you are just trying to fool the customers by giving 50 or 60 percent off on the very first order .it was not so good. it is very very bad...!\n",
      "We have been having a grand time whenever we visit Barbeque Nation Gachiwoli.. Be it the food, the ambience and the hospitality of the staffs, this place is a must visit.. the staffs here treat you as a part of family and serve you till you get the utmost satisfaction on the taste and quantity of the food.\n",

      "It was a payday and was looking for pocket friendly restaurant in Indira Nagar area when we encountered Karachi Cafe!! As you enter the restaurant you time travel to 80s-90s era. The wall paint, bit rugged, and the walls decorated with movie posters and advertisements of the bygone era. To submerge you in that majestic generation they have kept a black and white television set, radio and a landline with round dialling pad, milk cans, kettle, glass jars, and of course the attire of the waiters!! The old melodies make you just go wow!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Kabiraji and Macaroni Pink Grilled Chicken Pasta!!\n",
      "Let's discuss each in an order.\n",

      "Chicken Kabiraji was so tender and delectable that you will just forget about the surroundings and will just relish the flavour of kasundi with the awesomely fried cutlets dipped in beaten egg!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Next delicacy, Macaroni Pink Grilled Chicken Pasta. Remotely similar taste of pasta which I experienced was a long time back. The blend of red and white sauce will leave you speechless. The quantity was great for two.\n",

      "The food, well I had ordered pav bhaji which was again okayish.I don't know how the keema pav tasted though.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "To go along with the drinks we ordered charcoal spiced chicken and a folded cheese omelette. The chicken starter was good with perfect amount of spice perfectly burnt to get that charcoal feel. The cheese omelette was just good with little cheese as my expectations were high. Overall Food was good.\n",

      "The restaurant is good, food is good. Ambience of the outdoor seating area is average. They really need to improve on the service front, it took the restaurant more than half an hour to prepare a coffee and a sandwich. There were no menus in the seating area. The setup is semi self service. You have to go to the counter to give the order but they will serve you at your seat.\n",
      "Best quality food with rich spicy taste in reasonable price, biryani lovers you can try for special chicken price , the staffs and manager is very coperative.\n",

      "best one\n",
      "Nothing good. Tried buffet. You need to get your plates for starters. Water will be provided only if you ask. Starters are not at all good, especially fish. We didn't seen any difference in look between fish and baby corn. Main course is limited and are not available readily for us. We need to wait for 10min to get curries. Roti are pathetic, not fresh. Even desserts are bad. Only good thing is icecream which is served in single cup\n",

      "Visited this place in person and also had food delivered from it. The Mandi and the biryani are some of the personal favorites. But I happened to order the egg soft noodles from the place and it tasted really good and the quantity was pretty filling. The biryani of the place is packed with flavors and accompanied by perfectly Cooked meat. If you are a biryani person and want to try some of the best this place should be on your list.\n",
      "This is my second visit to this place. Like the Ambience much and cool place to chill out. Had been there along with a friend for dinner. We didn't want to go for Buffet for sure, so it was ala carte.\n",

      "A nice noisy eventful Saturday night happens here. Well typically if you are stags very difficult to get entry on Saturdays and by luck you are in you have to dance outside of the dance floor. Food was above average. If you're a party guy go on weekends.\n",
      "For the first time when I has shawarma here it was great and thought of ordering it again... but the issue with these kind of places is that they just serve good food until they are famous and once done the quality descends drastically... the best shawarma I had is at SK Shawarma DLF and other opposite to food bazar nizampet...\n",
      "I don't know why this place is rated 3.9, it easily qualifies for 4.2 and above.\n",

It is the center of attraction for food..Have heard many people so finally decided to visit this place..While I enter into the bakery the baking smell made me more hungry..I have ordered paneer burger and aloo tikki burger..After giving my order I thought to see what kind of bakery products they have..while I was at muffins rack, I saw the muffins and there was white fungus was on top of it..Very disappointing..They should change their show case items..\n",
      "Then I got my order..Aloo burger was good but paneer burger was horrible..it was too spicy and only red chilly powder was dusted with mayonnaise..And mayo was too sweet..I was not happy with service as they have numbers of chain in Hyderabad then atlist they should maintain the quality..\n",
      "Hi . Though I love the place . The service offered was pathetic to say the least.. the restaurant didn't offer the Gold privilege saying they don't offer it on weekends . Later during exit when I checked with the manager, he said there is no such thing .. but we were already billed til then . Our serving staff also asked us to pay via Google pay without bill. So please beware of these things when you are you are at the restaurant.\n",
      "It’s true that ambiance is good, but the staff has failed to direct me to the restaurant. Though I requested to book a poolside table they didn’t reserve, only the buffet people will have access to it, it seems. Food was good. But the staff was not professional enough.\n",
      "This was a fantastic place to go the outer view of this place with golf course was marvelous, hospitality was good and every attendant informed about their food well\n",
      "It was nice experience going there and especially their noodle bowls are awesome\n",

      "They had a widespread authentic menu.And since we were very hungry,we ordered almost every thing.And all of the items left us craving for more.\n",
      "You would find plethora of coffee. It is paradise for a black coffee person.The way they present their dishes,and the way it tastes is something you wouldnt get anywhere else in the country.You are the best,Driven cafe.You have my heart.\n",

      "So I haven't tried most of their dishes but what I've tried is the Chinese cuisine. And I must say its really nice. Do try out their veg fried rice as well chilli chicken dry, or chilli paneer dry. These dishes have been pretty amazing whenever I've been there. So do try ;)\n",

      "Nice old school ambiance. Irani chai n biscuits are very nice. Fav tried and tasted dishes- chicken sandwich, Bheja fry, irani chai, paneer burji, Bombay biscuits and fruit buiscuits. Very weird but true- pasta is amazing. (Feels like not the right place to have pasta but it’s good😍)\n",

      "Nice location\n",
      "Decent ambience\n",
      "Require a bigger or brighter hoarding in order to spot the location\n",
      "Deli9 has a lots of good food to offer and that's why I flock the place pretty frequently. My favorite here is their Pan Fried Fish steak sizzler (if you are not a fan of sizzlers, request them and they would serve it sans the fanfare). Tried their grilled tenderloin steak as well, but it did not live upto the expectations. It was dry and chewy sadly. Their pastas are quite tasty (we tried ours in pink sauce), so are their pizzas (we tried garden veg). If you like fish and chips, try it out here, will not be disappointed. Their cold coffee isn't that great, bitter and watery (I like the creamy and balanced kind). If you like mocktails, I would suggest that you leave out the Ginger Lime fizz. It's a poor version of our limca. The mojitos here are pretty refreshing though.\n",
      "Food is delicious. Chicken BBQ mandi, Mutton Fry Mandi and Chicken Burger are awesome... Good Ambiance and service...\n",
      "Owner and Staff are courteous\n",
      "This place is located opposite Star Super Market Gachibowli . Place is good ; Decent Ambience . Staff is Good but food isn't upto the mark . Taste less...Maza nahi aaya\n",
      "Worst service provided!!!! The ambience felt like a zombie area. The team over there was very confused for nothing.From the time they started taking the order til the time of the bill the waiters were so unpleasant,so unhappy,so irritating(especially a lady there) OMG that lady started giving rude replies when we asked for service . The manager there was \" Lost \"too. Food wasn't that great, it's not worth that price. Overall experience was horrible😑#Totally unhappy# Never recommend anyone who opts for a good lunch or dinner\n",
      "This place is not as good as jubilee hills branch, very less sauce used for wings. Which will disappoint you with the real taste. Ambiance & Service is good.\n",
      "I ordered Chicken 65 from this restaurant on 19th feb 2019, the quality of the food was not good, i had vomitings immediately after having the food..\n",
      "Quantity is less.\n",
      "Good food, good service, value for money, friendly staff, Sabir, one of the staff members was at our service, did great job. It has a splendid menu, both in non veg, n veg. P\n",
      "food not good because biryani rice not spicy just plain rice given to me\n",
      "The food was really great when I went with my office colleagues. The staff was not much supportive and made us wait a long time but as per food, the taste was great, the paneer lababdar was great. Paneer chunks were soft, the curry had all the flavours, the butter naan that I ordered, I must say , had too much butter but tasted great. The special chicken biriyani my colleagues ordered was great also. The staff were little on the edge, but the food was really great.\n",
      "Awesome,delicious,mouth watering  do not know what else i could say for the taste..it is a place where you have to spend more but once you taste their cake i am sure you'll forget what you paid..one of the best i had..i wish they were in another cities as i keep travelling..\n",
      "25mins late..\n",

      "Very smooth delivery and timing. Happy with the service :)\n",
      "It is closed as of 14th May. It is not mentioned on Zomato. Please call before you visit this place. I wanted to take my parents to the place but they referred me to Mustang!!!\n",
      "The hotel never updates the status of the order. I called Zomato support after 20 mins of placing the order, then the Zomato support team calls the hotel to accept the order and then they update the order. Next them mention it will be delivered by 1:11pm but again no update. I called again at 1:15pm to check what happened to the order. They again called the hotel to get an update. Then they mention your food is still getting prepared, its in the kitchen. What the hell the order that should have delivered way back its still in kitchen and you guys don't mind to update or apologize. I asked to cancel the order and Zomato said it can't cancel as it will be waste of food. Great and I am stuck with the hotel's will to deliver it or not. Pathetic service.\n",
      "please provide spoons with ice cream\n",
      "Ice cream was good , but it's totally got melt as delivery boy took a lot of time to reach. He mentioned it as delivered as soon as he picked order. He took nearly 45 minutes to come.\n",
      "Visited here for buffet with my office team ,the place was very nice , ambience was very good and there is no veg biryani in buffet but they provided after asking that was very nice \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall experience- Good \n",
      "\n",
      "Will visit again and try some other dishes .\n",
      "I found this place pathetic. Went yesterday, most of the dishes we ordered were not available. The excuse waiter gave was that one of the chefs is on leave. I wonder if business stops for them if one the chef is not available.\n",
      "I read on zomato reviews that their thali is good. And restaurant's menu on zomato mentioned that thali is available in dinner as well, but on reaching restaurant I found out they are not serving thali in dinner now. I travelled 9km to visit this restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food was pathetic as well. Tanduri roti that we ordered was made of maida. And the dishes were either too oily or just bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall this place is very bad and doesn't deserve a visit at all. There are plenty of restaurants all around Hyderabad which are much better than this for half the rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid this restaurant at all cost !!!\n",
      "Friday Night must desserts-\n",
      "Amul has an outlet near DLF CyberCity Gate 2, Gachibowli which is fully crowded on the weekends. This place is small and has less number of tables available. It is decorated with the lights and the loud music plays in the background. People love to enjoy desserts here after having the street food at DLF.\n",
      "They serve a large variety of ice creams, brownies, sundae etc. We ordered Belgian Chocolate, Rajbhog and Kesar Pista ice creams cost near INR 75. All of them were delicious and mouth watering. Service was quite slow, as they had many online orders in a queue.\n",
      "Overall -\n",
      "A casual place to on every weekend for the desserts along with the friends.\n",
      "The food was simple and tasty. I also like the ambience and the quality of the dishes. Service and the restaurant were overall good and soothing to one's mood.\n",
      "Nothing bad, nothing good. Just there. Service is just as expected. Hygienic as should be. Orders are taken good. Orders are completed in expected time, good parking space... just all good. All good is not good. Can we have something more? It's a little dull place to be this joint.\n",
      "Visited on Christmas eve. I must say overall ambience is good. But buffet desert menu is limited and cost of the buffet must be updated on online zomato menu.(i.e online mentioned rate 999+ taxes which is actually 1200+ taxes)\n",
      "The place on outskirts in Financial District. Have visited this place on February 1st DJ Suketu 1st Friday of 2019 with Office team. The Property is huge as you enter the Club. There not much seating for crowd as I have heard its biggest club in Hyderabad. The food was tasty and service very quick even after they have huge crowd. The staff is polite and helpful.. DJ Suketu was awesome he played superb Bollywood tunes. It has a seperate smoking zone outside which is good. Overall its good experience.\n",
      "Went here for lunch, it's bit different than usual bbq buffets starters were impressive, service was good. You will get wood fire pizza here, due to heavy crowd when I went the pizza was not baked properly. They can improve in dessert section. Rest all are good and different than regular buffets.\n",
      "We dropped at this place on Sunday morning for breakfast. It's a small cafe with quirky posters and phases on the wall which will definitely catch your attention.\n",
      "Coming to food, we ordered two combos : shawarma + Nutella waffle + citrus mint cooler and best of both worlds. We also tried spiced bell pepper omelette which was really good. Other items were average, nothing great. Quantity of the food was good.\n",

      "Grate place for food lovers, the tempting and mouth watering dishes are speechless, loved the ambiance and the vibe of the place, surely recommended for its food and ambiance.\n",
      "I have visited Jonathan's kitchen on many occasions. One thing that strikes me is for such a big restaurant, their service is not so nice. Also, they denied us Zomato gold services saying we were sitting in Komatose, however as per their front staff, they told us to sit in Komatose as they didn't have seat in Jonathan's kitchen but the food, menu and staff will all be from Jonathan's. Hence we sat and ordered and later, found out, no gold accepted.\n",
      "I have tried their buffet, ala cart, Sushi and everything else, Nothing extraordinary. The only benefit is, it is close to my place.\n",
      "good sarvic\n",
      "I am shocked and I ever had in my life food taste like this in th any common food court of India it was my 2nd visit in 2 days, M impressed by veg Galaouti kabab what a flavour , smoothness, textures, binding, combination of paratha , now I am a big fan of Norfest.. it's simply located in food court no necessary and unessary interior, simple and fresh, love the food.\n",

      "Dal makhani with parata\n",
      "Food &quality: 3/5\n",

      "\n",
      "Various types of salads are available, if you are a weight watcher or you are a conscious eater :)  I went mad over the Hunan Chicken, it was just amazing. Peri Peri chicken was so tender and juicy with the perfect amount of spice in it. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I went the spread had a mix of Chinese, Italian, Continental, and South & North Indian food. \n",

      "\n",
      "Will I go again? Definitely!\n",
      "Ambience wise it's the best rooftop place one could possibly ask for. The behaviour of staff however is highly disappointing. They have this bad attitude as though you're blessed to be dining there, now that certainly isn't accomodating, is it ? In fact, it ruined the entire experience despite the place being amazing and food being great. I guess it really is important to keep tabs on whom you're hiring.\n",
      "If you are from north and you miss its chat then this place is a must visit for all chat lovers. They have tastiest samosa chat and bhel puri and their pani puri is so so amazing.\n",
      "Nice restaurant ! Good burger but the interiors could be better .. very basic interior !they should upgrade the interior ... otherwise nice food I guess\n",
      "The service is fantastic...govind is doing a very good job...he is doing his job perfectly....good taste is excellent...good place to have buffet\n",

      "We had our team lunch over Feast, The buffet spread was very huge which includes Indian Chinese and continental, coming to the desserts 🍮 we there were about more than 25 which I really loved it. The price is bit expensive 1125/- inclusive all taxes, it is worth going to this place\n",

      "Highly recommended place.\n",
      "Its a made to order cake shop. We got some cupcakes and cookies from here. Cookies were nice (it had to be it costed something 650 for a box of 15). Cupcakes were just average.\n",
      "I am sorry to say this but nothing, i mean nothing in this place was exceptionally good. From food, to taste, to hygiene, to the supporting staff, to the ambience - nothing just made me food good and welcomed. We were a group of people who went there and none of us were happy with the food, or the food spread, or the taste specially. I remember nothing from what I ate as extraordinarily good. I have been to westin buffet, novotel buffet, trident buffet, avasa buffet and alllllll were way way better than this place. There has been absolutely no work done on the ambience to look pretty or attractive. It also wasn't that clear like other restau. the place did not even smell good. I would never visit this place.\n",
      "Closed ambiance, loud. Food was filling, we ordered veg platter and the pizza is a must try, thin crust with a good amount of cheese, if you're a cheese lover do try it.\n",

He know what I need , before I ask he will Arrange it. I really like this thing's, thanks Sheraton and thank you dharma\n",
      "Shawarma is not like shawarma. It's like rumali roti filled with chicken khorma or sweet roti filled with leftover chicken curry nd some mayo in a corner that you might have to search.\n",
      "Taste wise they are OK, but I don’t trust their hygiene. Had ordered through Swiggy and were disappointed with the quality of food. Chicken lollipop was undercooked. There was red blood inside the chicken pieces and had to pull to tear the chicken.\n",
      "We ordered strawberry delight , virgin mojito, crispy corn and chicken 65. Crispy corn was too salty and the chicken 65 was not cooked properly.\n",
      "It was my first time to taste this dish and totally satisfied. I cut down that 5th star because it lacks spice and realized that there are spicy sauces that can be added to the dish, after our plates were empty.\n",
      "Good ambience and service\n",
      "The ambience literally brings you the vintage feels. The service of this place is brilliant.\n",
      "When I visited this place firstly I had ordered for some bun maska and Sulaimani chai, really liked it. I also had the chicken kabiraji, personally I felt it could have been slightly better.\n",

      "Don't drink water in the given glass for more details please check attached images...:)Or ask for plastic glasses or take water bottle and drink with it only.\n",
      "I had ordered thrice from here and each time the Chicken Dum Biryani was mind-blowing! Superb taste and with two pieces of leg pieces most of the times, it's total value for money!! But unfortunately I was going to order it again and see that they have removed that Chicken Dum Biryani from the menu..😒 That's bad! I really wish they put it again so that I can order it again...\n",
      "Should be bit less oily and spicy.\n",

      "Had been here many times becz its nearer to ma Place.. If u want to eat very spicy biryani, i say that u must visit kritunga.. All items here are known for their spicyness. But ambience wont be that much classy. But one can go if it is not an issue for them.\n",
      "The desi pub with the beach theme. They have both the indoor and outdoor seating. But they usually provide only the outdoor seating, as they keep their indoor seating mostly reserved. You might reserve and still end up sitting outside. The food was also good. The customer service is something that needs to be improved.\n",
      "Top picks :\n",
      "Chilly Prawns\n",
      "Cheesy Fries\n",
      "\n",
      "The chilly prawns is a must try. The mocktails were okay. Not much varieties when it comes to mocktails. Overall, a great place to hangout.\n",
      "very bad packing, quality of rice and gobi curry was bad. Better read delivery reviews before ordering. Zomato should look into the quality of packing before delivering\n",
      "good\n",
      "This outlet located on 10th floor of SLN terminus, is our team dinner venue.rlRestaurant had a decent ambience, but open top can have some more mild lighting. Brewery is available. But as we booked a buffet in bulk , we got limited options for food and alcohol\n",
      "\n",
      "Food has got 2 veg plus 4 non veg appetisers.\n",
      "Main course was very limited. Biryani's and gravy each one for veg and non veg. Tandoori rotis and nans. Desserts were very limited. Vanilla ice cream and gulab jamun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alcohol has 4 options. Bacardi white rum, antiquity whisky, Smirnoff vodka and kf beer.\n",
      "Mocktails, cool drinks,soda and fruit juice available for Mixing. Loud music with Divine drinks on breezy Roof top is definitely worth a try.\n",
      "It's a pocket friendly but not a customer friendly club. Have been here with my friend and I see the staff was busy with own works rather than offering a menu card. When the same was raised with the manager, he was very arrogant asking us it can't be changed.\n",
      "The place is a definitely a crowd puller but they should remember that even the best clubs go down the pecking order as the time goes.\n",
      "Never going to visit this place again.\n",
      "Ordered lazeez murgh biriyani, quantity is good, taste is not good..biriyani is very sweet, mint raita is also not good, they didn't give onion salad also\n",

      "But their alcohol section is decent\n",
      "Service is fantastic and the waiters and staff are really kind\n",
      "A cafe by the legendary Karachi Bakery,it lives upto the name. The ambience literally transports you to old times with posters from old brands and smallest of details taken care of. Like the television and telephone from the old times that no one uses now are a part of the decor. Service is also good with prompt and courteous staff. Food presentation is good and taste wise, can't say much as we only tried the Irani chai (which was really good). Overall, a really good experience.\n",
      "Bagels 🥯 is what I have most loved here and the pasta is great as always!! The staff is friendly and quick. Overall it is a bit expensive but if you have some free time to spend,do visit this place 😊\n",
      "Worst food in Hyderabad. Very low quality and old stock food they serve. They are serving old stock food items after that not accepting their fault at all. Very rude behavior.\n",
      "Worst service food. Those who want blood pressure problem may visit. Every thing highly saalted. Don't go on name mathura it's local. Worst food worst service\n",

I asked security about valet parking and he said, yes there is valet parking, so I gave key to park my car. In fact, that security guy was very unprofessional, and He never told me that there is no valet and he parked my car in a non-parking area. I was shocked when I received a message from traffic police about challan which was issued on 15th Apr 2019 for traffic violation. In fact, it is very impractical, and owner should educate to security not to provide any wrong information. If restaurant does not have valet parking, then the customer has the responsibility to park her or his car.\n",

Though the restaurant claims to be authentic original Hyderabadi taste the Gachibowli branch was open in 2015. Given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic.

Anyone could dance, feel you or ogle at you and not one single staff to monitor anything.\n",

High standards set with first dish, expectations were only growing as we waited for Lebanese chicken , it was just juicy , cooked well and was fresh and tasted great. So a 5 on 5 for starters. Now moving to the the attraction of the day, the Mandi it was authentic Middle East preparation, with tangy spicy gravy accompaniments, ordered juicy mutton Mandi, mutton quality was above par, Mandi was great , if you are a spice lover, Mandi is not for you. Ended the day with baklawa which was usual.\n",
      "Recommend must try place for Mandi\n",
      "Chicken nuggets must try here....bbq chicken mandi is too gud....but ambience is not too gud...and not so neat...\n",
      "But itsgud only for taste food..waiting time is too high bettween 8-10\n",
      "The restaurant is not hygiene. All houseflies around. The staff especially the receptionist was rude when asked about the hygiene. Even if you order food, they don’t provide basic stuff like plastic spoon along with food. Totally disappointed with this restaurant.\n",
      "Have been there several times and have opted for delivery too.\n",
      "\n",
      "They serve pretty good authentic North Indian food. Mutton Rogan Josh, Butter Chicken and Dal Makhni are top notch. Very flavorful and authentic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Galaouti Kebabs are by far the best item in the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Story goes that one particular Nawab of Lucknow, who was an infamous couch potato, had lost the use of his dentures and was looking for something pate style, which needed no chewing yet imparted the flavors of a fine kebab. So Galaouti‘s were invented.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the mutton Galaouti’s served here, are exactly like mentioned above. Very soft not much chewing required, they just melt in the mouth. They are served with ulta tawa paratha's and is a must must try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pricing is very economical and occasionally they offer 50% discount too over Uber eats.So, if u have a thing for North Indian cuisine it's a nice place to go.\n",
      "Never order full meals online... At the end you will get disappointed with incorrect items.. From the given menu... Expected alot by seeings reviews.\n",
      "Super Tasty Maggi\n",
      "A very nice place with a very humble staff. Quick service and a hospitable ambience. Very delicious food, probably the best biryanis in the country and the starters are no less either.\n",
      "it was nice..\n",
      "I have ordered willy Wonka for home delivery.. It became over frozen by the time I received the same.. I did a complain and very next day Cream stone sent another ice cream for free.. Keep up ur good service\n",
      "We've been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since I am a big fan of starters.\n",
      "So as soon as we reached the spot, we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the Gachibowli area. The interior was also tiny and seemed confined.\n",
      "Anyhow we ordered chicken garlic, chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant. The staff were ok, not quick but not rash though. Even though they got our food very late, they somehow tried to convince us with something non-relatable situations.\n",
      "Forgetting all that, we just wanted to concentrate on our food. As soon as we had our first bite, the first thing that came to our mind was - it's good but not great. The flavour in the Biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices.\n",
      "Overall, it's a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay/work near Gachibowli. This is not a place to visit from a long distance.\n",

      "We were a group of 10 out on a team lunch. We opted for a mix of veg and non veg buffet. The spread, right from the salads to the dips and the desserts was wide and each of the individual dishes were delectable. Do try the Dal makhni and Indian dessert options.\n",
      "This is a must try place and worth the money you pay for the experience.\n",
      "Wonderful place with good food taste i like the way they prepare the food. There i like they serve to us and the way they maintain the restaurant clean\n",
      "Recently we were invited for a food tasting session here at Marsala Food Company! We had heard mixed reviews about this place soo wanted to check out how it actually is! Well to start with, as soon as we entered we were quite impressed by their interiors and their seating arrangement! They have the Arabian style of seating i.e sitting down on with the food placed on stools and also they have the normal high table seating for people who don't wish to sit down! The place is dimly lit and very calm! You can enjoy the food with an overview of the traffic passing from infront of the DLF gate no 3, opposite to which is this place Marsala Food Company! So after we settled down they brought in the soups, we had the Arabian Chicken soup and the Lemon coriander soup! We just loved the Arabian Chicken Soup, it was really tasty and the chicken pieces were very tender! Whereas the lemon coriander soup was a bit spicy which is quite unexpected and also we felt it could be a little more improved! Next came vast spread of starters including both veg and non veg! The starters included Chicken pahadi, Paneer papdi, kung pao mushroom, Dragon chicken, Haryali fish tikka, Golden fried prawns, Golden fried babycorn, chilli paneer, lahori chicken kebab and mushroom moti tikka! Starters were really good in taste! Specially the non veg and seafood starters! Chicken pahadi, a dish prepared by marinating the boneless pieces in fresh mint, coriander, ginger and garlic paste and yoghurt, had a very refreshing and delectable taste! The chicken pieces were really tender and very properly cooked! The dragon chicken was a bit spicy and juicy but really good in taste! The golden fried prawns and babycorn are prepared by marinating them in the battered paste! These are really crispy and amazingly tasty! You definitely are going to love the starters here! ❤ Next they brought their famous Mandis on our table which included Mutton Juicy Marg Mandi, Grilled chicken Mandi and Fish Fried Mandi! Although all of them were good enough the one that stood apart was the Grilled Chicken Mandi! The rice in the mandi is very flavorful and yummy! And the chicken is grilled to perfection making it juicy and tender! The quantity was also ample...it can serve 4! In between all the starters and the mandis they also served us their milkshakes which had kitkat milkshake, Butterscotch milkshake and strawberry delight! Strawberry was our favourite! Made of fresh strawberries this shake gives you a refreshing taste and also You will order for another one 😉 And at the end of it all, we were served the desserts...the desserts which You commonly see in the Hyderabadi functions! They had the Qubani ka meetha, Double ka meetha, Kaddu ki kheer and Gulab Jamun! We strongly feel that they should improve on their desserts! They were just okay-ish! Dessert is the way to Man's Heart...soo it shouldn't be taken lightly! But overall it was a good experience here at Marsala, the staff was really nice and friendly and the food except for the desserts was really amazing! Do try this place...specially for their starters and the grilled chicken Mandi! 😍\n",

      "Visited this place for buffet lunch with team.The Starters were very good.They will serve starters on table..Even the main course was good...Loved Phirni and Chico Lava cake as well.However, the ice cream was not good.Staff was courteous as well..\n",
      "Well we’re new to Hyderabad . And I can for a fact say that it’s probably the best place I’ve eaten a buffet at in Hyderabad period . Especially id like to thank Shurvo and Papiya for their amazing service . Double metha was just too good . Overall a worthwhile experience\n",
      "It was an ok ok place ambiance was quite ok\n",
      "Every item in the menu was costly and the sizzler was also not upto the mark\n",
      "Serving was a bit slow and preparation time was high more or less it was not a fine dining experience\n",
      "It's good place to visit. Pradhan was serving us. He was polite and friendly. Had a good time. Like to visit again at night for checking out.\n",
      "worst quality\n",
      "Went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place. Had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try. \n",

      "\n",
      "Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.\n",

      "Most of the staters were served was of same taste n less grilled.Fish n chicken n prawn everything tastes same.After repetative reminder also they served the same.Also there is not much varieties are available for stater.Main course is ok.Deserts are pathetic.They are serving it for namesake..It's a horrible experience overall\n",
      "I usually dont write reviews. This is perhaps my first one and you should probably guess the level of my frustration with this place. Just one word...small and deplorable. Cold food and poor service sums it all. Quite surprising that this is part of an elite chain...actually shocking. Have spare money...go to a better place....not this one.\n",
      "Good food and good service. Good options for vegetarians also. Desserts are very tasty. Ambience is also neat and the place looks very hygienic\n",
      "A friend of mine recommended this place .....The best part of this place is the variety of Beers that are available. Very few places in Hyderabad where beer taste is nice and it will be one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food is above average and Ambience is nice. Sports lovers can hangout here enjoying their drinks.\n",
      "One definitely have to try their coconut bun and cream cheese bagels. Bread loafs are so fresh here, and we can get variety of cheese. Super place to hangout.\n",
      "Serving not upto the basic standards. Place smells wierd and costs not at all fair. Not a preferred place for vegetarians. Most of the items on the menu not available\n",
      "Very good food with great ambience . specially Govind's service was extremely good with very good behaviour who had a very good attitude throughout our dinner\n",
      "This restaurant is not for people who like dum biryani. Its a royal dining restaurant with that kind of interiors and biryani tastes good as well\n",
      "Apparently on holidays,half their staff too goes on a holiday.\n",
      "The service was horrible, took them 10 minutes to clean our table and another 10 minutes to serve us water.\n",
      "If this wasn't frustrating enough, they took 30 minutes more to get us undercooked food and some of the dishes in the thali were cold.\n",
      "Ordered food from this place which has very interesting menu but not so satisfying taste..However,the variety of items which are available seems to be good..\n",
      "chicken bad smell and seems it got spoiled.\n",

      "Rahmath, Ripun - good job 👍🏻we are very happy there's service also lovely pic again visit soon love abs ,,,,,,,,,,,\n",
      "I have been there here thrice. The food is simply amazing but it's too costly.\n",
      "Must try : crispy corn , cheesy french fries , deli 9 spl pizza and munchuria noodles lunch combo.\n",
      "Mocktails : virgin motijo\n",
      "was beautiful-peaceful and relaxing. Staff was outstanding. The restaurant was exceptional along with the hosts and servers. A must visit place\n",
      "Everything since I entered the restaurant was a disaster. I received cold food after 45 minutes after I placed the order, that too after multiple complaints. The drinks quality was not good. It happened twice that the staff forgot the order after we placed it. They had to be reminded about the order. Overall very bad experience regarding food quality, drinks quality and service. Would not recommend to visit.\n",
      "This is relatively new place. Glass onion has a good ambiance and surroundings. Tried pasta , grilled chicken and couple of other starters.. service is very slow .. otherwise a good place and priced well\n",
      "I visited this place on last Saturday and I really enjoyed the evening. The best thing which I liked about the place was only groups and couples were allowed to enter the Dancing floor which does not happen in Delhi . I really liked the food and the crowd, would love to visit again .\n",
      "They charged money for ketchup but they didn't provide any ketchup without ketchup how people can eat Gobi Manchuria and onion lemon are also not provided so no taste\n",
      "We went for breakfast to cafe eclat on a Sunday morning. We ordered spinach omelette, belgian waffles, coffee and gelato. Everything was delicious but over priced for the quantity, especially the waffles. Overall, it's a good place with happy vibes. Just a little overpriced and the portions are small.\n",
      "awesome food\n",

      "Looking for a romantic dinner? I would say this is one of the best place in Hyderabad. Amazing ambience along the poolside. My review is based on the session invite.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started our dinner with Thai coconut soup. Perfectly cooked veggies like carrot, broccoli, zucchini dipped into the coconut milk. It was very tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "In starters, we were served Beetroot paneer Tikka and Sikampuri kebab. Plating was very tempting. Paneer Tikka goes really well with the chutney they served with it. And the kebab, it was the best Sikampuri kebab I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and moist inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "In mocktails, they suggested their best sellers which were apple cooler and minty mango. Apple cooler was little tangy and minty mango was on sweeter side. I just loved the latter one. It was very refreshing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then comes the main course. We had Malai kofta - modak shaped kofta layered with cashew curry. Sweetness was balanced and delicious in taste. Must try with their herb paratha. We also had Stuffed capsicum - one of the famous and ultimate dish in India. If you have only curry, you may find it salty, but have it with capsicum and you will feel it like a heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "In dessert, I had brownie with vanilla ice cream. Brownie was nice, soft, crispy outside and moist inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, my experience was amazing with Mazzo. Bhuvnesh - the main chef is very humble person and his suggestions were really helpful while having a dinner. I also enjoyed the service from their courteous staff.\n",
      "wrost food in my life waste of money\n",
      "Cake was stale\n",
      "bhindu do pyaza is good, but chapati is not well cooked\n",
      "One of the best place to have biryani in gachibowli.\n",
      "Biryani is best here. Service is good.\n",
      "Good thing is you can get 1+1 on food here. Enjoy the great food\n",
      "This Place was really amazing, as usual the staff is very polite, Appreciate their work in maintaining professionalism, loved being serviced by Saif Ali Khan and staff..\n",
      "Can improve your main course and desserts spread. I would have rated 3 but I am giving a 1 because one of your servers' behavior was bad in our office party. When my friend asked for a blue lagoon, he insulted him in front of everybody by saying that blue lagoon is for kids, not men... just because it's a soft drink. One need not believe in others' beliefs and customs, but at least respect them and not insult them. Train your staff appropriately.\n",
      "I have booked for a corporate lunch at this place. When we went to this place to be frank we are with zero expectations on this but at the end the of our lunch all my teammates are happy with this place. Best part here is their starters, desserts and chat items. Here jelebi with rabdi is extremely super 😋. Service was bit slow but their respect towards customers made us forget that. Only area where they can improve is the main course options. Thanks Indi Grill for giving us one of the finest lunches ever we had.\n",
      "I'm a pure non vegetarian, but this place became an exception after I first went there. They serve fresh, hygienic, tasty and flavourful food. They also serve warm ghee with each meal (unlimited).\n",
      "\n",
      "You should try this place. It will change your perceptions on veg food!\n",
      "I ordered with them yesturday and got chicken in my veg pad thai!!! :( very disappointed with it as xhilli potato was really nice. I dont recommend anyway who is vegetarian as I couldn't even reach them on phone....\n",
      "This place is beautiful and has lovely ambience. Food tastes amazing and service is good.\n",
      "Been to this place numerous times and every time i go I feel it new. Overall a place worth visiting.\n",
      "This place is good for your friend and famlily.they have good variety of appetiser.\n",
      " Their service is very freindly. I have visit twise in this hotel  and also seafood verity is superb.. the dj was also great my over all experience was very nice..\n",
      "Thakk you....\n",
      "Awesome food.. good ambience... ,,, Very humble staff. ... Food also really good and testy...,,,,,,,,nice place everything is ok but need to lmprove of service?.\n",
      "Kirak Bole tho kirak Hyderabadi language just loved it had a nice time enjoyed the food mainly pan Kulfi loved iiiittttttttttttttttttttttttttt\n",
      "Excellent food and excellent service by mr Krishna and ijujal I am full happy either the food and service thank you gays and thank abs I am coming again and again thank\n",
      "Worst food received, low quality rice was used, egg fried rice was almost spoiler, unable to eat. Worst experience ever, does not recommend.\n",
      "It's good, quick deliveries, i like it, and I used it first time, feels good but need some lemons and onions more, please try to do that 🙂🙂\n",
      "Couldn't help but indulge my sweettooth in this store located in the Dlf lane. India's first to introduce Gelato as base of their shakes. You can choose your base between gelato or avalanche, which is basically yogurt based icecream.\n",
      "New menu is interesting. Happy to see savoury items on the menu as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tried Coffee hazelnut shake - must say the coffee is neither mild nor overpowering, just the right amount and was good. It's loaded with whipped cream topped with choco chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caramel Brownie shake--- now this is a stealer. Would give a 5 just for this. Probably the best caramel shake I ever had. Total yumminess. Even the colour is drool worthy. A must try here. Yes the sugar content is high and too sweet. Some pampering for your sweet tooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peri peri fries - how interesting is it to get options for your fries, when you even love them as such. I opted for peri peri spice and it tasted good and is for someone who really like their fries spicy\n",
      "\n",
      "Tried crushers passion fruit flavour which was okayish\n",
      "Although we booked our table, the suitable table couldnt be found for us. One guy passed to another one and we sat outside. After this they send inside. Finally the table was found for us.\n",
      "We ordered Jägermeister and Baileys but we had nuts for the prices 375 and 450 (see the portion).\n",
      "Ok I understand that prices are fluctuates, but we didn't know that we paid for this little shots. These drinks serves with proper glass with ices, BIGGER PORTIONS, THIS IS CHARGING.\n",
      "Will never visit this place again!\n",
      "Awesome ambience, superb music, definitely a great and most happening place. Bit costly place I feel and crowded as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect place for friday evening party!\n",
      "Had amazing combos at karachi bakery , the combination was very good garlic bread with pasta , pizza and chicken wings , chicken manchuria and noddles , all things were lip smacking.\n",
      "Good place to spend time with friends and colleagues.. DJ is great.. and loved the bar structure..service was quick and staff were quite interactive. would like to appreciate Anmol the bar staff.\n",
      "Pathetic experience I have had in recent times. Arrived for buffet at 2pm I. Saturday afternoon. The food was cold as ice, no starters at the food table and support staff least bothered about checking on food and customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing that was severed as per it's level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will not prefer anyone to visit this place and was a disappointing experience for a office team lunch and regret choosing this place as option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Really disappointed\n",
      "this is not up to kfc\n",
      "The best place to have Punjabi cuisine. Ordered Paneer Mussalam( Paneer stuffed masala curry)with cheese and garlic naan and was divine. Mushroom cheese starter and Honey potato chilli were mouth watering. Loved this place and the waiters were were very polite.\n",
      "Been here with family over a dinner on Thursday. After a movie was thinking about having a luxury dinner and feast hit my head. The ambience was good. The hospitality was great. Need to mention about Chef.Chimnayi and also steward Dharma for there living hospitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to food, the spread was big with and uncountable with cuisines like Lebanese, chinese, Indian and continental. After so long I actually loved the taste of almost all items. Be it salads, starters, main course and finally my most favorite desserts.\n",
      "\n",
      "They served 18+4 varieties of cold & hot desserts which are prepared by their own and not outsourced.\n",
      "Special mention chocolate pudding, gud ki lapsi, wood fried pizza, salads, baked yogurt & pure ghee be an ladoo.\n",
      "Food 5/5\n",

      "Too costly and food was not up to the cost quantity also very less i will not recommend to go to this place, Crowd will be less and waiting time also little more\n",
      "Good food, great service... Been coming here since years and the best thing is that it's always been stable with the food quality & service... Good place to hangout... Love it 😊\n",
      "Service was good and food also good ambiance good I had chicken biriyani and egg biriyani both are really good nice service with good food overall good\n",
      "On the B-day I was looking for a place which has outdoor/poolside sitting and after searching lots of places around including Prego which I also like, Mazzo by Marriot came up in the results while Zomato-ing and I thought why not to give it a shot. . Anyways, this place was in my list since long to explore but I was looking for an occasion or right time to visit and what could be better than a dinner date on your birthday! ...\n",
      "Read full post on vidzkitchen.in\n",
      "excellent\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Till now its the best place for a perfect dinner date if you really have one 😉. Food i rate it at 3.5 as pasta we ordered was half cooked but quantity was better than my expectations.\n",
      "Been to this place on a weekend surprisingly the place was empty but started to fill in soon..ordered prawns and paneer tikka..they tasted good...also ordered corn.. didn't taste that great...coming to movcktails I've ordered aaamsutra didn't feel like there was alcohol in it..the fruit punch was pretty good though...the music was too loud coz of which we couldn't have proper conversation...a decent place to chill n dance..\n",
      "good\n",
      "It's a good option but the bread they use for hot dogs and burgers is something which has to be improved. Burgers buns are too thick and the patty and filling at times is way too oily. They have pretty good dining area too on the first floor. The place is neat and service is pretty fast. Being an old brand catering to twin cities this place has always been a good option to grab some quick bites and lip smacking pastries.\n",
      "He was so punctual and cooperative\n",
      "Great ambience, awesome cocktails, delicious food, fabulous service. What more do you need from a place. Music could have been better. Recommend Pennicilin for Whiskey lovers\n",
      "Food and ambience is nice..\n",
      "Chiken chettinadu and Chicken pulao is toooo good so as beer and vodka....\n",
      "And I appreciate Kamal's quick sevice..👍👍\n",
      "Quirky interiors + Great food = Perfect! Must try - Coffee and brownie! This place has great interiors and it’s not just about the food here. At Driven Cafe, you can even hire cars and bikes!\n",
      "Want good back grounds for a retro themed photoshoot and while you’re at it , munch on some delicious food? Karachi Cafe , Gachibowli is THE place for you!\n",
      "Food:\n",
      "•Peri peri chicken- This dish includes chicken breast topped with peri peri sauce ,is served with mashed potatoes ,Garlic bread and sautéed vegetables.\n",
      "The chicken was properly marinated and cooked to perfection with the tenderness still intact, it was already sliced to bite sized pieces.\n",
      "•Chicken pesto sandwich- The sandwiches have a filling of chicken marinated in pesto sauce along with cucumbers and tomatoes; served with potato wedges and tomato ketchup. It has very light taste and perfect meal for two on Hot summer day.\n",
      "•Bun Maska- Literally the best BUNS you could get your hands on! Filled with fresh cream, melted butter and a layer of white sugar, it’s literally addictive!\n",
      "\n",
      "Beverages:\n",
      "•Cold coffee- The beverage wasn’t cold or strong enough to be called as cold coffee in the first place. Would not recommend this drink.\n",
      "•Irani chai- generally Irani chai is suppose to be milky and sweet but this wasn’t very sugary. It had a mild yet tempting taste . Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambience: Every wall is decorated with vintage posters, articles and artwork, the front panel of the cafe is made of glass which gives a beautiful glowing effect to the space and the green plants add to its beauty. Perfect place for a formal meeting or a casual hangout with friends or family.\n",
      "Been many times here and the place is not crouded during dinner time, the best time to visit this place is during dinner time only as lunch time too much crouded with office guys specially Mon to Fri, coming to food , prawns and fish starters are too too good , other kebabs also too good, staff is too good in service and they treat us like kings and queens, I strongly recommend Gachibowli branch as less crowded during dinner and weekens\n",
      "So was here like 10 mins back, the place is kinda okayish but considering that price range it becomes even more undesirable.. dessert was probably the best part of the whole course.. everything else was mediocre at best. The Atmosphere is lack luster so even that doesn't help.. So yeah not the most exciting places to visit\n",
      "Food is okay but not that good , you can miss ordering food from here and you will not miss anything. I had a chicken Biryani one day and it was not able to finish it as it was not that tempting\n",
      "We went here for lunch on a girls day out and were amazed with the classy ambiance and decor.\n",
      "\n",
      "First thing that made us happy was the interiors and the way the place was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tried veg platter for starters which was delicious. The quantities was just right for two people.\n",
      "\n",
      "We enjoyed some mocktails alongside and a bowl of corns.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is a bit expensive but I think it's worth it as we loved the food and the ambiance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We certainly would love to revisit it on a date night and enjoy the rooftop experience. At the time we went the rooftop was closed as some renovations were going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommended!\n",
      "Very friendly staff... Good service... I went for Mandi but even buffet was looking nice. Good and different taste of Mandi as well. #ArabianRestaurant\n",
      "I visited this place on a weekday in the evening to have a snack.\n",
      "- Ambience was good. Service was prompt and responsive.\n",
      "- I ordered Pineapple lemonade, cheesy fries and chicken burger.\n",
      "Liked the cheesy fries (with mustard sauce)and burger.\n",
      "Overall good place to hangout and have a snack. Will visit this place again. :)\n",
      "Really worth for amount, many starters and those are good, soup and Gulab Jamon and curd rice, noodles are good veg biriyani, sambar and dal fry are good.\n",
      "Best Sunday evening of Gachibowli Hydrabad, Dj rocks awoesom Bollywood mashups live music was also very very good, I came with my coulege for celebration, after our Project launch party. Was full tired but good quality sound selection of songs, mature and professional staff change our constraints, restart our engine 😎😎🤗🤗.\n",

      "Suggestion.. Please ask to customer ki dal tadka mei kadi patta dalne ko. If requir then only add ... Thanks\n",
      "Read mixed reviews about this place. But the only thing which dragged us here is that the DJ here plays Bollywood songs and we were satisfied with the DJ and the dance floor. The place is also very beautiful. But the service here sucks, the waiters are rude. We couldn't order food as the waiters weren't responding properly. Even for drinks (tired of waiting for them to take order) we went to the bar and ordered.\n",
      "So if you you to enjoy only the dance floor, only them I would recommend this place.\n",
      "Good food but slightly over priced. But great service by Tapan. great ambience. Loved it overall. Tundey kebabs were really nice. Chicken tikka biriyani was also good\n",
      "We ordered alu parathas from here which turned out to be a mass of poorly cooked dry mass of wheat. Do not know about the rest of the things they serve but not ordering again for sure.\n",
      "Worst service. Strictly nor recommended for family and decent people. Taste is below average. BIG NO for this place.. Stay away. Worst service ever\n",
      "A fine place to sit and relax on a lazy afternoon.\n",
      "Food is okayish but on the expensive side.\n",
      "But the cakes and pastries are not recommended.\n",
      "Amazing place to be when you need a cool and chilled out place. Dine near the pool area for a soothing experience. One of the best ambience of a pool side drink with calm environment and amazing wether view.\n",
      "Worst service and management! Waiters will not attend you and all you have to do is wait even to get menu card. Manager's behaviour is totally rude.\n",
      "Good one. You get a combination of south and north Indian varieties in a single thali. The servicing here is very slow. I have been here twice and it took more than half an hour to get the starters. Staff are polite and friendly.\n",
      "Being a foodie and going for a buffet is like craving for a lump sum treat!\n",
      "But the restaurant has disappointed.\n",
      "1. Ambience and service was great.\n",
      "2. We went for buffet , firstly the starters weren't that good at taste. Common panner kebab type of starter, corn , chicken, veg kebab. Well none o them weren't good as having them twice.\n",
      "3. Main course was a disaster, very few choices that too of rare vegetables and less eaten. No panner the main dish, rice items weren't good. Skipped and went to the desert section.\n",
      "4. Desserts was like stabbing a dead man. Nothing exciting, only the ice cream was good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it is expensive and less satisfying. If you are hungry and looking for a buffet please skip this one.\n",
      "Good ambiene...Good food..Extra ordinary service by Raza and Shakeel...want pan icecream in icecream zone...Increase more biryani items..Affordable pricing\n",
      "I have always loved the TDS chain. Been to Kolkata, Bhopal and Hyderabad. But hyderabad has been the worst experience ever.Very bad service. We had to wait for long hours for the food to be served. No one was bothered even about the bill.\n",
      "Good food and service from tapan , nice taste , worth a try , located at the very central location convenient. Reshmi kebab is excellent try it out\n",
      "Very worse we even received one plastic cover in it\n",
      "Good food and service. Went during Hyderabad trip and had ala carte lunch on Sunday. Quantity and quality both were good. Value for money and good taste. nice ambience. Parking can be an issue during rush hours. But place is good.\n",
      "The worst behaviour of staff, we are seating on rooftop and went to dance floor leaving our belongings at our table and one Stuart comes and asks us credit card as deposit. What kind of service is this, in last 12 years i have visited 100s of pubs in India no one asked such. Dear SKYHY if u think u r one of top pub, listen there are more which give better service than you.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Horrible Sambhar, It was thick as chutney and had just potatoes for the vegetable bit of it. Chutney and Dosa were still fine but sambhar was real bad.\n",
      "Have ordered ulavacharu biriyani its very tasty and we liked it. Any new buddy.... Just try it once and you will love it. #tasty #loved #resonableprice.\n",
      "I became a big fan for their Chicken Biryani. I ordered thrice but there is no difference in the food taste and always tasted wonderful. 😄😄\n",
      "Ordered Tawa aloo paratha, Veg Manchurian and Badami Kheer. Paratha is below average, veg Manchurian is OK. No badam flavor in kheer, but it's a rice kheer\n",
      "very good\n",
      "good...\n",
      "Wonderful place,excellent wings especially spicy garlic , Sunny's service was great!great place to have fin.One time visit is required if u live in Hyderabad\n",

      "Service - 5/5\n",
      "We are a regular here. Veg choices are adequate, clean ambience, excellent food quality and a no-frill price. Given our experience, we hosted a get together at home; Lime took the catering work and were extremely professional- on time, well planned, staffs had a friendly demeanor and quality of food as expected was very good. Mr. Dinesh Ramalingam is the F&B Manager who we had liaised with and kudos to him- very client centric and reassuring. Thanks to the entire team of Lime. You rock!);\n",
      "no cutlery, no seal on the box, poor packing.\n",

      "excellent.. ordered for 3rd time.. simply superb...\n",
      "ok ok with taste\n",
      "Bad service and the attitude of the staff is bad as well. The food was good both in terms of taste and quality had they been good service would have been good experience.\n",
      "I paid for extra Choco chips..and I didn't even find single chin inside..it's so disgusting. I have already mentioned in instructions like..please don't forget add ons.stll they forgot\n",
      "Very bad service. 90% time you will keep on waiting for food. Even when i ordered thali, thwy took more than half n hour to bring it. Even the food was nothing compare to Rajdhani.....\n",
      "This place is my default option for south indian breakfast. Located right on the Gachibowli-Kothaguda road, this place serves Poha, idli, dosa, uttapam, poori sabzi etc. Personally I prefer their south indian food.\n",
      "There is a small juice counter outside the restaurant as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are looking for ambience then this place is not a great option but taste wise and cost wise it won't disappoint you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy eating! :)\n",
      "We can get a very good Maggi here I had eaten double chicken fried Maggi here it was very good for taste and look good for our eyes it was the best snack to eat\n",
      "As usual, awesome wings, try ur guts with blazin sauce with a compensatory ranch sauce. The drinks were good, say it cranberry or muzu, Sandeep and Vineet crafted it just awesome.. nice place to hang out with family as well. Adil and rose received well, they just now how to handle their customer with smile.\n",
      "Quantity is very less..... And not so tasty , but service is good. If it provide quantity with tasty food will help the restaurant to attract customers.\n",

      "Service 4/5\n",
      "Ambiance 3.5/5\n",
      "good\n",
      "Had the worst service of my life. Had to wait for more than 2 hours for the main course. It was later told that there was some problem with the kitchen. They later served food when we were standing outside and waiting for the bill. This could be a one off problem, but I expected better communication from the staff, so that we could have made alternate plans instead of waiting endlessly for 2 hours when they kept telling us that food will come in the next 5-10mins.\n",
      "So i make videos on YouTube on food and books and the name of my channel is TheFoodie Bookworm and I just ordered randomly from the place because it was similar to the name of my channel, but I must say that I am super satisfied with the chicken Peri peri shawarma and the pancakes. They are just yumm. Do try this place out.\n",
      "Nice food and nice service. Ambiance is also great. We wonder how you people manage all good food with good service. Great job. Keep it up. I liked all kind of non veg and veg crispy corns, that is my favourite.Special thanks to Ali and Mantu thanks for your good service for us.\n",
      "Taste is okay and ambience is just fine. But my experience with service here is not satisfied. Don't know whether I visited wrong time, but to be honest, cost and quantity is worthy.\n",
      "I have ordered tangdi kabab, I think being late nitr order this people have packed mixed chicken pieces, I got 2 tandoori 1 biryani leg pieces and one tangdi piece. I request restaurant plz don't accept orders if you don't have enough food.don't try to fool people.business success depends on trust and quality I think u should understand it.\n",
      "First of all the ambiance is lite and soft. U can feel relaxed here. The service was good and the food is good too. The starters were really amazing. Looking forward to visit again\n",
      "Went here for lunch with family members, ordered South Indian thali which is way more better than chutneys. Ambiance was okay. Service can be improved as we have to ask more than once to refill few items. Overall a good experience.\n",
      "I had bad experiences at this place multiple times. The management has no sense of customer experience. The people working there dont even respond to customers properly. While ordering, they don't check the inventory. We had to wait for 30 min for order to be served and even after that, there were some items missing. When asked how long it would take, they just responded vaguely. Iam not planning on visiting this place ever again.\n",
      "Ordered this delicious healthy dish! ❤ massaman veg curry and thai rice bowl... Loved it. Curry is so smooth and contains everything as described in the eat.fit. menu.\n",
      "Had great fun with kids, family exceptional hospitality especially Ranjit.Good variety food.worth place to have buffet with family.priced good\n",
      "The ambience was good. We 12 ppl went there for dinner. Some of us ordered biriyani, some had kulcha nun with Kadai murg. For starters we all ordered chicken drumsticks. Starter was delicious but they didn't provide salad and sufficient chatney. For biriyani they took much time and at the end when we tasted it we felt disappointed. They told special chicken biriyani and mutton keema biriyani are their special dishes. But the rice was sour. With biriyani the gravy they provided didn't have any salt. May b they tried to compensate. One of my friends ordered jaljeera which was the most humorous and worthless thing they provided and it took 40 Rs.\n",
      "And about the service, it was good till we pay the bill. Frankly speaking we found this restaurant from dine out app and we wanted to pay via that app. But they showed some vague reasons and showed reluctance to accept. Atlast though they agreed. Overall we weren't satisfied at all.\n",
      "half of the order was not delivered by the restaurant. and they didn't bother to pick the call for that\n",
      "I ordered food and they accepted it. Even after 2 hours the food was not delivered. I tried to contact them many times but no one answered. Worst behaviour ever. I had to finally cancel the order by calling the zomato customer care.\n",
      "I ordered boneless chicken biryani and food was not at all hot and it smelled like it was cooked long back. Worst experience. Not going to order again from this restaurant.\n",
      "Really awesome service by Ranjit and Santhosh ther make our visit so amazing. we are welcomed by beautiful host anita and jenny .Food and drinks are so tasty .specially wings with spicy garlic amazing.we enjoyed lot with gamings like TEKKEN7 and need for speed and special thanks to captain mandeep who help us with vr gaming.Finally thanks to b.dubs team keep rocking...\n",
      "It’s a hell of party when you land with your colleagues or friends at barbecue nation. I should not say about the tenderness of grilled fish, chicken and mutton kebabs being served as starters but also about the veg dishes that grabbed my attention. The main course meals were really nice and dessert was also pretty good for the meal package. It’s a must option if you are choosing for corporate meals, birthday celebrations or friends hangout.\n",
      "Here I can’t say the food is so tasty, it was okay you can enjoy some specific items in chicken those are nice.. and the ambience also normal but it was nice in the nights we can enjoy the outside view..\n",
      "I ordered Red Monster box mini for 95 rupees. 4 pieces of fried chicken were there. The taste was good. There was another box which had chicken makhani with biryani rice. The quantity was very less. It was not enough for one person. And the taste was also not so great.\n",
      "A nice place to taste some of the local delicacies..\n",
      "I really liked the rusty feel this place has, which takes you back in ages..\n",
      "Loved the started.. although pulao was not the best I’ve had.\n",
      "Overall, a nice dine out..\n",
      "Excellent food and service. Special mention for Papiya Shuvro. Surprised to see such good quality food being served at such low prices. Ambience is quite good too. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Nice ambiance and is a treat for people to watch and enjoy. It’s on little expensive side. Here we will be offered 3-4 menu cards 😜 Looks like it’s a combined centre for Eat India and Urban Asia\n",
      "Ordered chicken briyani and vegetables briyani. It's was good as usual!! If they could increase the paneer in the veg briyani that would be brilliant.\n",
      "Not plenty of gravy... Lack of test\n",
      "Picked up the box of cupcakes containing vanilla, chocolate and red velvet cupcakes and trust me, it's the best you might have ever had. Their packing is very classy firstly, adding to the elegance of those little cakes. I loved all three equally, but the smooth taste of chocolate - i can never forget that!! You won't regret gaining those calories ❤️\n",
      "worst taste i ever had\n",
      "Just wow 👌 I placed an order for Mutton Laham special mandi, it was really 😋 yummy. They provide a bowl of mutton juice along chat Pata 🍅 tomato red chilli 🌶 chutney with this dish & must say it really fetches and satisfies your hunger.\n",
      "I just say it's a MUST TRY once for sure. 👍\n",
      "A very bad experience ever. The delivery guy kept me waiting for more than an hour and yet no response came from the guy or from the chat support. Dnt ever go for this if u r starving. Not even a 1 star actually.\n",
      "This place is located close to the Hotel Radisson [ 5 minutes walk ] where I was staying, so I choose this place to meet a friend. It has got a nice decor and the seating was very comfortable and relaxed. We were the only customers inside this place during our one hour stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a Coffee Latey Shake [Rs.169] and my friend ordered a Coffee Caramelo Shake [Rs.169]. Both the shakes were really nice and thick. They are made with a blend of lots of ice cream, caramel, coffee and topped with whipping cream.\n",
      "\n",
      "On my second visit to this place I tried it's Go Guava Shake [Rs.145] and it is my favorite. It tasted awesome with plenty of ice cream blended with guava and topped with Guava crush.\n",

      "epicureantales.com\n",
      "Taste is good - best things to order : Banana bread ( I can eat it whole day super yum!!!!!!), muffins, pesto pasta, carrot cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outdoor seating was a disappointment for lunch and yes service little slow\n",
      "Ordered Jumbo Paneer Tikka Rice Fest. First of all it was nowhere near to being jumbo. Simply a small box and they call it ‘Jumbo’. Probably they have studied English from some remote island. Secondly the rice was so damn spicy that I am facing issues in my stomach after having them. This was my first and last order from Fassos. Will never ever order again from here.\n",
      "Starters were good. The main course lacked salt and a bit of lemon juice. We ordered the palak paneer. I've had food here once before and it was amazing then, so this time, it was a slight disappointment. Last time I had the chicken tikka which was really amazing.\n",
      "Awesome food, awesome service, awesome\n",
      "hotel, everything is awesome. Ambience is beautiful.staffs service is awesome.special to manager Dinesh..thank you so so much.\n",
      "best place to be for Saturday nights, these guys nailed it when it comes to their package. my friend suggested this place for dinner tonight and I simply cannot ignore their outdoor grills, more over they have Dj at the bar and live music outdoor. this gives you options to choose. cudos to the bartenders they made our day even better.\n",
      "Very nice place to get rid of your hunger in late night in hi-tech city.\n",
      "Ordered fried chicken Maggi. Turned to be good. Packing and taser was good.\n",
      "The waiter here. Specially manager srini is worst and rude person here. Suggest never go to this place , they treat people as they are getting food for free.\n",
      "Recently been to this place. Good food and economically priced. Service was also good.\n",
      "Most disappointing part is their crowd management. When they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. No bouncers to check what is going on floor. Stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. Just for their business they r letting everyone in.\n",
      "I will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. As there is no security for them. One should enjoy the party but with some limits.\n",
      "The management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a Rouge place. Lot of cheap crowd on Saturday night better to avoid.\n",
      "I had my daughter's birthday party last week and I am really happy with the service, food and staff. Mr. Dinesh helped a lot with Menu and other options and he arranged whatever I asked and he promised. Everyone who attend the party was very happy with all the arrangement and the service.\n",
      "Very excellent food and nice place to have dinner . Situ and Shantanu helped well to choose best dishes and attended very politely. Prawns is a must try.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Went for the dinner with the family. All the items were delicious. You must try the firni in deserts.\n",
      "Dont miss the platter and mouth watering non veg platters.\n",
      "Food is decent nothing out of the world, yet I am giving this place a 5 stars!!\n",
      "Good finger food nothing you complain about, but the vibe of the place post 10pm is just electrifying!! The highlight is the desi dhol beats!! Total paisa vasool place.. They don't really have a dance floor but the vibe is so great that every inch which doesn't have a table become a dance floor! Lastly, the decor is very pretty as well!! If you want to party cheap and have a blast, this is the place for you!\n",
      "Nice place to hang out... Food was really good as well as drinks.. Ambience and music was really good..Loved the DJ for friday night.. worth visiting the place.\n",
      "If you are craving for a chaat you must visit this place. I tried karara palak chaat, dahi poori and paani poori. Its not as good as we have it in north but definitely a must try.\n",
      "Been here in the evening and at the right place to get a view of the busy city road and enjoy a sip of chilling drink... food was indeed a surprise factor and was really tasty with some quick service.\n",

      "Good\n",
      "Ordered a lime soda with biryani. Recieved lime soda in used kinley soda bottle opened, half filled. This is ignoring basic hygine and acceptable packaging. The restaurant is risking people health. Not sure what else they will be compromising on.\n",
      "Amazing place.. If you visit at day then this place has an entire romantic environment and if visit at night then this place gonna rock your night!!! Service is good... Music has a standard... Foods are okay. Dance floor is nice too.. Best is architecture of the pub !!!! However the staffs are insisting for 5% tips, which I didn’t like..!! Otherwise good... Hence 4 star otherwise it deserve 5 star..!!\n",
      "I have ordered multiple times from this restaurant and I have never been so upset. Of course I have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which I ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now. Orders can't go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city. Yet another incident today where my order was wrong. You can check with my name what I ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th May'19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes I wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either. They deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time. Guess Zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right.\n",
      "This place reminds me of Pune's Khau Galli. The parathas were awesome, with the butter it gave a homelike taste. The priving is reasonable. Its a good place for coming with family, the seating is sufficient for 4 people.\n",
      "The aloo paratha, gobhi paratha and paneer paratha were delicious and upto the mark. But tandoori aloo paratha and Makke ki roti aur sarso ka saag were some other level. Very nicely cooked and incredible taste.\n",
      "Worth a visit . Highly recommended\n",
      "One star only because zero star is not an option.\n",
      "Probably one of the worst and slow place in Hyderabad.\n",
      "Only one bartender/waiter who was not even in the bar for most of the time.\n",

      "Tempteys is my favourite place for shakes.. Its a place which makes me little nostalgic as I have some very happy moments attached with this place. Just a glass of shake from Tempteys and it automatically lifts my mood. Every shake has its flavour. Sometimes its so hard for me to settle on one and I just wish I cud drink them all. Name any and its there.. Naughty nutella, FerreroRocher , kitkat shake, Oreo shake, Toblerone, choco brownie, berry berry blast and what not.. The only word for this place is “Excellent” and it speaks all. :) The only thing I wish from this place is that they lessen the cost a bit .Its a bit on the higher side .\n",
      "One of the best Chinese restaurants in Gachibowli -Hitech city area. Chilli paneer and chicken manchurian are great choices for starters. The momos are also good , huge and filling. The chilli garlic fried rice was flavourful but the Singapore noodles was just okish. We ended with fried ice cream and were totally satisfied by our choice.\n",
      "Service is a little slow, this can be improved.\n",
      "I have never rated a place one star before but this place dissapointed me to the core!\n",
      "Ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing, but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese ,oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving. Food was so spicy that we were sipping water after every bite and after few bites i had started tearing up. It was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (P.S. we are a family who loves spicy food). Also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate. Highly dissapointed with food!!\n",
      "This place is amazing for weekend fun hangouts and let your tireness go away. The DJ is awesome and plays best bollywood songs and punjabi too. The veg pizza and pastas are pretty good to try along with fruit punch. But if you want to have a good fun filled and energetic time go here. This place the best music to groove to and has pretty ambience to get clicked.\n",
      "This was place was a surprise as it is better than you imagine. Though it turned out to be a bit hot, the air circulation could have been better. The food and drinks were as how they were described. Must try.\n",

      "Poor Service. Have ordered ice cream and it took 1 hour to reach me..by the time when it reached it's not like ice cream it's like milk shake... completely melted. They didn't add solid ice inside the package at all.. too pathetic online delivery service by creamstone gachibowli branch... Never expected this from them because am a big fan of creamstone...it disappointed me badly by it's poor service\n",

      "The service was disappointing. The servers were in some hot mess - confused how to circulate the starters. We were five members, we got the table promptly as we had prior reservation. We decided to take the buffet. We were told that starters are being served pretty much like some other joints. The sitting arrangement in the restaurant is haphazard, mismatching furniture (probably some kind of interiors they thought to make a different style statement - which is not an issue for me). The welcome drinks were served only for 4 members in the beginning. Had to remind them to serve one more. Only three plates were provided, so after a wait of 5 minutes, the rest two of us got our plates. We told them, almost 3-4 different staff members, that two of us were opting for non-veg and three are vegetarian. They would either serve vegetarian options at a time or non vegetarian and then totally forget our table for 10-15 mins. We had to remind them to serve us more. Plus, they kept bringing the same starter again and again, despite telling us that there are other starters too. For e.g. crispy corns arrived at our table - I lost the count how many times! Some starters arrived only once. Some veg starters were cold !! Almost after 45 mins, the two chicken starters that they told us in the beginning arrived.  Main course was alright. After spending an hour, my appetite was already gone. I still made a selection of prawn curry, it was delicious. I had it with naan and some rice as well. Desserts were also running out of supply by the time we were ready for it. Overall, the whole excitement of having a team lunch at this place was lost, mostly due to poor service.\n",

      "As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag. The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan, Saag was good but lacked salt in it. The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole, a must try and must have at Norfest. The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person, the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill. The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well. The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good.\n",

      "Awesome experience from the beginning. Amit and the manager was too customer centric. They had a private party ongoing and they still took care of us very well. My kid was feeling cold so they bought a shovel that was too kind. Zomato Gold was accepted without any issues. Ordered Long Island Ice tea which was perfectly mixed and Margarita was Awesome. They served the buffet on the table while we were having our drinks. They checked with us every 20 minutes to make sure we had a good time and TASTY food. Lastly they bought a cake for my wife to celebrate her birthday. Definitely going to recommend this place for perfect and tasty food. Thank you Amit and the Manager on duty\n",

Extremely disappointed. Money lost and no replacement provided from the restaurant....not worth it!\n",

But more than anything it was the manager of the outlet who took the cake in terms of service stand up chap, props to him!\n",

Coming to menu its kind of same what all bbq places are offering now a days. Taste was good for most of the items. Staffs were polite and quick on services. Only thing which didnt went well was AC of the resturant. As it was a hot afternoon, AC was not enough to cool us down😕. Manger apologized for this. They also gave us a 10% off on total bill because of 20+ people.\n",

      "Somedays it's decent but somedays it's so not good. Yesterday we ordered fish paella and the rice was tasteless just dipped in chilli water. I love spicy food but not like this.

But the service needs to be improved in terms of the staff availability for taking orders and re-orders. The food was quite average. Liked the veg nizami we ordered for main course. The veg manchow soup was really bad though. The taste of food can be improved. Overall,not a very satisfying experience.\n",

      "They need to work on their milk shakes and other shakes as they don't taste the way they look, the taste is bland for the shakes.\n",

      "Pulav is not properly cooked. Looks colorful but tasteless. The gravy is too sweet. Naan I could see the uncooked dough.\n",
      "I came there with my friend as stags. It was written stags are allowed till 8 pm but the reception person was unkind to say “you are not allowed “ at 7:45. He was looking down on us just cause there was no girl. The other point that he raised was that my friend was not wearing shoes. It looked reasonable.\n",
      "Overall, it felt humiliating and I felt it wasn’t a decent place to even receive you.\n",
      "Have ordered from this place a couple of times and I must say that I have not had better alu parathas in Hyderabad than what they serve here. They are filled in so generously (unlike most places) that you can literally see small chunks of potatoes falling from them.\n",

      "Absolutely delighted with our overall experience. The shop had an excellent festive decoration. Ideally there would be very little to talk about the ambiance of a takeaway cake shop but this place is an exception. The moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. They mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. The price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. We were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. The brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. This was one of the best brownies I have had in a long time. We also bought the cup cakes and they were yummilicious as well. Want to try everything in the menu in future. Keep up the great work!! Will definitely recommend.\n",

      "Situated a little away from the main road Aromas serves quite good Indian as well as Continental dishes including Chinese and Thai food. The cost of all the dishes are at the lower side as compared to the other restaurants. It has an average interior with both indoor and outdoor sitting. Though the service here is not so good but the food covers it all. I really liked the taste of the north Indian food that it served. It has true north Indian flavour. I loved Gulaabi Chaap which is a betroot kebab. Lehsuni dhaniya murg , Sholay kebab , Malai warki paratha, kastori kebab are the other tasty and aswumm items that I tried. Undoubtedly it comforted my taste and was happily back home .:)\n",

      "Maybe all these 4 and 5 star reviews are paid ones. Ordered aloo paratha... First of all quality of the food is bad. Bad odour from raita and then instead of sending pickle, they sent something where I can only see mirchis but no pickle.\n",

Go or order from NorFest, I was deffinitely vow after having sambhar or idli for couple of days when I ordered from this place. Big fan of them, tried their all outlet and I must say good pricing with awesome taste (Without curry leaves :)))) in Hyderabad (No Offence to south indian  food).\n",

      "Went for Christmas Buffet Lunch. We were 4 of us. The staff were very friendly, courteous and cooperative. 5/5 for the service. But the food was very very disappointing. The starters were unmentionable. The chat counter, Palak Chaat was good but kanji Vada was pathetic. In Italian, we asked him to serve us ravioli, which was very hard and the worst we have had. The saving grace was the Indian counter. The curries, Biryani, bread etc. were all good. I think the restaurant should stick to Indian and not venture into other cuisines till they are better prepared to do so.\n",
      "I had first been here on my bday last year. This place serves some Kickass fried chicken starters. The service is prompt and lovely. Adding the Zomato gold on top of it just makes the experience even better. Deriving recommend it.\n",
      "Been here quite a number of times and have tried their varitey of burgers, pizzas and grilled chicken. My all time favourites have been cajun marinated chicken breast and tex-mex burger. It is just the way they cook the meat that it becomes succulent and juicy without losing any of its flavors. I would highly recommend the tex-mex burger. Delicious cheese and patty with vegetables makes one hell of a bite. Their pizzas are also taste worthy. Despite being a non-vegetarian, I really enjoyed their garden veg pizzas with their thin crusts and generous toppings. \n",

I booked buffet in dineout offer. So, it was good deal for me. In general, I felt 1300 for buffet with this spread and taste is expensive.\n",
      "Food was not good and tasty enough while we got food all the pieces were meshed up.\n",

Then we had the tuna salad which was too bitter to eat . Couldn't even finish it ! Then we went for a very cheese pannini . Another dish we couldn't finish . The bread was too thick to eat ! overall huge disappointment for me !\n",

      "Really good place in gachibowli. Ambience is average. But good place with good vibes and crowd. They have their own brewed beer with taster pack available. Open area is good to enjoy a nice breeze and good view of the area. They have a dance floor. There are karaoke nights as well. On weekends there might be cover charges and would suggest going in couples to avoid stag fees. Entry is from side in the building SLN terminus. lunch menus are bad. Food is just average here. Most of the gravies taste same and brown in color. Overall worth a visit. Good place to enjoy music and have fun.\n",

      "Fine baking it is! Place looks classy. It is expensive for a takeaway. Staff at the counter was not very warm. Cupcakes are good especially the chocolate ones. Only drawback is they let you buy in specific flavours and quantities and you don't get to pick and choose your favorite ones. Berry crumble loaf is one of my favorites.\n",
      "Hey guys, your resturant sucks big time. If you guys cant deliver then put a big lock on your store. But please dont cancel after 2 whole hrs after confirming the order in 5 minutes. Never gonna order ever and will advice same to others. wish i could give a zero rating, dont deserve to be 4.4.\n",

We tried the bamboo chicken which is an iconic telugu appetizer that has soft tender chicken cooked with right amount of spices. Mamsam vepudu which was the star of the show with spicy, perfectly cooked mutton that justified it being telugu cuisine. The Rajugari Kodi Pulao was the best of all.\n",

      "To start with , the complimentary drinks Blue mojito , pacific blue , fresh lime soda were refreshing. The nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken , prawns or fish. Head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day. The veg starters - Mushroom is a immediate No , cripsy corn was not salted properly , paneer came as a saviour. Maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer. Coming to Desserts : Its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled. Browine was too dry , cakes were not tasty, apple/pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup , phirni an absolute no , kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it. Overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section. I can only rate it 3 for food , 5 for service , 3 for ambience as its too crowded going neck to neck in every counter.\n",
      "I had a great time here. Real good spread of food. Mahesh looked after us very well. Overall really nice experience. The desserts are excellent and curd items were very tasty\n",

      "Fantabulous ambience with great food. Royalty can be experienced at Khaan Saab. Went there for New Year's Dinner with Family and the food we tried were yummy & lip smacking. Dhahi Ki Galouti will stand out among all other dishes and is definitely worth a try. Other dishes we tried were Paneer ka Soola in Veg, Lal Mirch Ka Teekha Tikka in Non Veg, Hari Mirch Ki Roti in Breads & Angarey Jamum in Desserts. All of them were exceptionally good. Only thing we felt was prices are steep for the quantity they serve. But all is well when the food is great and ambience is awesome.\n",

The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. Barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute. Btw, this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad.\n",
      "Only masala is der in biryani tooooo much spicy am seeing dis from 3times I ordered but same like diz only they r giving wrost biryani 👎👎👎\n",
      "We went for our Friday dinner. Ordered the large paneer paratha, which really was very large to finish it off by one person. It had a good stuffing of paneer inside. It was well covered with butter and along with came the ideal raita.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only we stopped here, we ordered small aloo paratha, Gobi paratha, which were hot and yummy!\n",
      "The chole masala was not okay. But the paneer curry was delicious with paratha.\n",

      "The place was awesome, we went for team lunch last week. Ambience was good, food were awesome and tasty. There was bit delay in service but it's okay, lots of item to taste them up, mostly the starters. There were varieties of dessert and price was worth it. Thanks La La Land, we will try again to visit...\n",

      "The food was different from what I ordered and this is 2 nd time I Think will nvr order again\n",
      "I have ordered khema biryani and chicken roast, both of them were not good, khema biryani was too bad. I have visited kondapur branch many times and I liked the food, but this time I had a very bad experience\n",
      "Confused waiters.... half order .... items not available.... customization not available... ahhh total chaos.... but surely not truly Chinese... it's more northeast... nepali food as they are more on spicy and oily side. May be I should have tried thupka or some other northeast specialities.\n",
      "Give it a try once and do not order corn soup as it has more Aararote powder mixed\n",
      "The food in the breakfast buffet is good. There are a lot of varieties to choose. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Keep it up. Overall I had a satisfying stay in Sheraton. I would like to recommend this hotel to the others.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pasta was amazing. Loved the crunchiness of veggies.\n",

      "\n",
      "And no response form the restaurant num of the number were working\n",
      "Quantity is not worth for the money...\n",
      "One of the worst services I would have ever come across. There were two incidents at the same cafe and the feedback given to them was not even reviewed.\n",
      "The first time, I ordered an Irani Chai and it took them 1hour to serve and it was one first chais ever consumed. It was served in a broken glass. Very disappointed.\n",

      "I went to Jonathan's with team. I fell in love with their ambience and seating. Their buffet spread is good and seats are comfortable. Coming to food, I had the best buffet. Everything is so good\n",
      "So beautiful, great DJ nights, economic, great open air ambience and good food. It has always been my weekend spots. Lovely place to be. Must visit if you live near by Gachibowli.\n",
      "Pathetic biryani ever I had. In my life.. If u really wants to eat biryani then don't order for here.. Better look for other options..\n",
      "\n",
      "Only the packing is good but food is not at all good..\n",
      "Absolutely everything about shah ghouse is amazing. You wouldn't mind the ambience much as food is finger licking good. You can tell that the place serves good food as it is always crowded. They serve the best mutton biryans, shawarmas and murgh musallam ( not sure of the spelling).\n",
      "5 stars 🌟 only for the food 🤤\n",
      "Have tried cup cakes from so many other places. But I haven't got the cup cakes anywhere like here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red velvet and Chocolate are our favourites\n",
      "We had a team party of around 40 people and the service over there was pathetic. We took buffet for all, but for each starter they where taking atleast 45 minutes(when asked the waiter's they use to tell will get in 2minutes which never comes) because of which we had to directly jump to main course and leave the place.\n",

      "Service - 0/5\n",
      "A classy restaurant in Gachibowli area that serves super awesome Hyderabadi food at a very reasonal price. The waiters are polite and accommodate any special request you have as to how the food has to prepared\n",
      "Absolutely pathetic. I placed an order for half kg mocha walnut cake. The order was taken over call and rest of the communication like what message is to be written on cake etc was done on whatsapp. When I called the next day to collect the cake, they could not find my order. I had to call multiple times and finally I was told my order is ready. Upon reaching the outlet, the message was not written on the cake and they hurriedly packed a cake and gave me. When I asked them if this is really mocha walnut, they said yes you can see the walnut on the cake. They even had no idea of how much payment is remaining or how much I have already paid. Upon reaching home when the cake was cut, we realised it is not mocha walnut but butterscotch!! The outlet cheated me and so I called them and blasted over phone. I reached the outlet at 10:30 pm at night and slammed the cake in the store and demanded my money back, I was paid back the amount but the experience was terrible and bitter specially because it was a b'day cake. The store management is pathetic and there is no coordination or even an ounce of professionalism in them. Never ever going back and I strictly recommend anyone to go at their own risk. I will, for sure, completely avoid this place.\n",
      "Doesnt entertain ordered placed through food ordering apps. Had to wait for 45 mins before cancelling the order. I even talked to the cashier.\n",
      "After assuring the order will be ready in sometime, there was no update.\n",
      "Over fried French fries. Buy one get one in Bengali sweets which have a limited shelf life - you guessed it right they are almost close to expiry. Spicy pasta despite asking for no spice.\n",

      "The food was amaaazzinnng....nd ambience was really cozy and great!!!and there's nothing negative about it it was a FABULOUS visit...\n",
      "Staff are just polite and responsive. Food is the best part here. And it is better as ambience also awesome here. I met two persons here named Papiya and Shuvro who are the best at their services. Food items i liked here were Basket biryani and Kodi drum sticks. Finally just loved.\n",

      "Wen i got my food, i was amazed by the platter. It was so much food for just 129! and everything was yummmm. It felt like authentic chinese. Moreover all my colleagues tated the food and loved it. Great going Squeeze @ The Lime. You guys made my hectic day very pleasant.\n",
      "Loved it totally.\n",
      "From now on everyday without lunch box at office would be Squeeze @ The Lime day.\n",
      "Worst Biryani I have ever tasted..... Experience was not at all good.. Staff is also not so cooperative.. Ambience is also not that good.. Okayish..\n",
      "Very Awesome place for people who loves the Continentals with European . I totally very very impressive of Frio's Team hospitality . My favorite here is English Chese Balls and chese cake.\n",
      "It was a funny experience there. While the main course is quite satisfying, the deserts were a total let down. The ground floor could definitely do with some ventilation, the fumes from the washroom will drive everyone away.\n",
      "Very friendly and helpful customer service by Ijajul and good food..wide variety of starters. Been regular customer here.. Good ambience.continue the same.. Spicy fish was too good. Enjoyed finally.\n",
      "Food is good, especially the taste, but range is limited for main course. They have a good dance area though not marked out and hinders the movement. Outside seating is decent and service is better.\n",
      "Nice place to hang out with friends. It has live cricket screening, quite big screen. Food orders are served within 10 mins, quite quick. Good ambience. Good service. It is a place to revisit.\n",
      "Taste is average ,quality is good ,quantity can be increased a bit as per price but overall its okay for daily meals,butter chicken and chicken manchurian is what i prefer of this shop.\n",

      "ordered chicken popcorn rice blow where chicken popcorn was missing. And 6pcs boneless strips had only 5 pcs.\n",
      "I cant fully comment or give a full 5 star rating but I would definitely start with a 4 star as the kebabs I ordered were simply one of the best I have ever had. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered Chicken Malai kebab and Chicken Hara Mirchi kebab. Both the kebabs were juicy and succulent with individual distinct flavors in each of them. I really like it when one kebab doesnt taste like the other and each has its own unique flavor. While the homeminister like the less spicy and creamy flavor of the chicken malai kebab, I preferred the tangyness of the hara mirchi kebab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although a bit on the pricier side, given the flavors and the taste, I am definitely waiting for a chance to order their biryani because if the kebabs are to go by anything, the biryani would definitely be flavorsome. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food - 5/5\n",
      "Value for Money - 4/5\n",
      "Omg I won't forget this place forever. I usually visit this place at least once a week. All thanks to my coworker(s) who makes my visit more memorable and refreshing. This place serves decent coffees and frappes. I would give 5* for ambience and 4* for coffee and food. Being a coffee freak couldn't resist to come down to this place.\n",
      "The place to have one of the best Biryani’s in hyderabad. Chicken and mutton biryani are both awesome. The food is hygenic and well cooked. Chicken 65 and chicken biryani are a must try. Veg starters are also taste worthy and relished at time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers Rakshita Nath\n",
      "1.Half of ice cream spilled inside the package only..\n",
      "2.I ordered Caremel sutra...But I got Brownie Ice cream\n",
      "3.and I cream is in liquid. state like a milkshake....I did not expect this from cream stone at all...I have pic of them with me.\n",
      "Please deliver in time when you take an order. Your service sucks. And so does your delivery algorithm!! How can you show 0 minutes for 15 minutes near the delivery location\n",
      "I won't say not to try non veg in this restaurant it was good but palak dishes are awesome.\n",
      "Must try palak paneer and paneer kaju biryani ❤️\n",
      "fast delivery\n",
      "ordered tea but received milk\n",
      "Ambience of the place is amazing with good music. They have three types of seating arrangements, inside, lobby and open space. All options are good. Book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends. Hospitality of the place is also very good. They serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded, they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer I have ever tasted. The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn’t chur chur, it was plain naan. Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. It was extremely good in taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are in Hyderabad, I will highly recommend to visit this place.\n",
      "good\n",
      "I had ordered the smoked chicken pasta in red sauce. I wouldn't say it was the worst, but it was not up there. There was no smokiness like the name claimed, just bland chicken and rather a trail mix of vegetables that didn't really need to be there in it, in the first place. I would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no. of vegetables (maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out). Also, the \"smoked chicken\" needs to be upgraded. The spaghetti was also slightly overcooked.\n",
      "Had a great time here. I really love blazing sauce, that's the spiciest thing I've had, ever.\n",
      "Our server was actually the best part, he was cordial and attentive. He suggested tone we should try\n",
      "Excellent food and ambiance one should definitely visit this place.especially services provided by Nandan and Varun them is awesome.even Nandan is cool guys.try egg pellets there.\n",
      "Beautiful ambience. The vintage look took me back to some good old days. The food was okay but they take quite some time to bring in the order. For instance, 30 min for a glass of Coke? We had been here for dinner and it took us a while to figure out that both urban Asia and Eat India company are together. The staff didn't attend us for a long time. I gave the 3 star for the ambience and the experience I had with the people I went with.\n",
      "Inedible super spicy food\n",
      "Zomato information is wrong, it says the place closes at 11. we reached at 10:30 and the place was closed. The staff was quite uncourteous and turned is it quite impolitely.\n",
      "good\n",
      "The Glass Onion, hope it belongs to Global by what I've seen there. This place is built located exactly beside a Golf Course. The inside is just neat and calm. The food served is as good as their service. A calm alcoholic evening spent there is just astonishingly peaceful in the middle of the busy IT hub.\n",
      "The most happing place for me.. multiple visits because of their terrace seating and large screen.\n",
      "Multiple match's I watched here with my friends.\n",
      "As compared to multiple places in hyd, it's bit costly but worth it.\n",
      "Taste less food,not well perpred & egg shell had mixed in food so please check once while preparing and quality is also not nice ,this is the reason\n",
      "the Restaurant didn't follow the special instructions mentioned\n",
      "Its a awsm experience...i just love creamstone's ice cream..very fast delivery nd never delayed me order....i wish it will remain same..ice creams are so tasty and once someone order frm here am damn sure they never think to go to another icecream shop to eat icecream.\n",
      "very spicy and vada is uncooked.. disappointing\n",
      "Ordered biriyani , chicken butter masala and tandoori rotis... Quantity wise it's good.. taste is nothing extraordinary but yes , can be visited again...\n",
      "Nice place to eat and enjoy within budget. Biscuits are famous and various imported chocolates. Well behaved staff and management. They should start their own website to deliver food.\n",
      "I ordered from eat.fit and sorry to say the food was at all not good. Both taste and quantity were below my expectations.\n",
      "The food I ordered was Masala egg curry with Vegetable Pulao with Order Id: 1676056120\n",
      "\n",
      "Zomato delivery guy when delivered I realized that curry was spilling from the box. When enquired he said this is packaging problem.\n",
      "After Zomato incident all the restaurant have changed their packing but eat.fit seems to be not bothered. \n",
      "After opening the box the food was just half a bowl. Rice taste seems to be of very low quality. Bad service from eat.it and from Zomato.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first and last order from eat.fit. Already uninstalled Zomato . Overall very unpleasant experience.\n",
      "The name of this food place and the ambiance is amazing. Food is expensive here, meaning high cost and less quantity. The taste is good. It is advice to them to train their servers to get knowledge of all the items on the menu.\n",
      "I will not recommend this place at all....I visited this place today with 7 friends\n",
      "We were escorted by one of the tiki shack staff and asked to sit on a 8 seater table\n",
      "After 15 mins another staff member came and asked us to move to another smaller table (meant for 5 pol max) when we asked for reason he was super rude and said this is Friday night and we will accommodate 20 ppl like you on this 8 seater table\n",
      "\n",
      "I was shocked by this behaviour because we booked in advance before going there and i was ashamed in front of my friends that I recommended this place\n",
      "\n",
      "After 10 mins of requesting him to give proper table We started to leave and no one cared as if they don't even bother ..When I complained to receptionist he finally responded positively and managed to get us a decent seat where I can accommodate my 7 friends\n",
      "\n",
      "Now after all this drama no one was in mood of party so we left within 1 hr\n",
      "\n",
      "Many thanks for spoiling our Friday night\n",

      "Komatose on a Sunday night is the perfect place to be, happened to be drizzling, which made for the perfect atmosphere to chill outside in the cabanas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside was a pretty small area for a bar, but had loads of seating space which extended out to a floor above, overlooking the area below. Lighting was funky and great, the vibrant colors adding to the vibe. 💓\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a big bunch, we ordered different drinks and luckily I got to taste all. The most special of these were from 'the 7 deadly sins of Koma' menu. The taste was as described on the menu. Lust in particular was something different I'd never tasted before, a chilli-spiced vodka, strawberry infusion🌶️🍸.\n",
      "\n",
      "The appetizers we had we're really good, something I enjoyed more than the alcohol.\n",
      "Dragon prawns🍤, Grilled pomfret🐟, Peshawar Chapali Kebabs are some of the must orders! Didn't quite like the Nawabi Shikhampuri. While all the items tasted great, I felt the portion sizes to be rather small for the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best for the last, not being a kid here, but the mocktails were just mind-blowing. Had a few different fruit flavors, peach, mango, green apple, lime, out of which the peach was the best. Multiple rounds of that gave me the sugar rush 🍹.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was professional and quick. Would've wished for better music, and there was no DJ at the music station. However we had the freedom to play our own songs which was great! It's a perfect place to watch a match screening, have a party, or if you're in the mood for it, go into 'Comatose' 😉.\n",

      "Ulavacharu is one of the best south indian cuisine here I have tried in Hyderabad city.. Being a north indian (oppps, West Bengal is not considered as a northern state, so being an East Indian) my first step for an authentic Andhra rochulu (am I pronouncing right?) Went pretty good.. The ambience, decoration & presentation were amazing.. Food taste was amazing.. They serve 2 laddoos as complimentary when you sit on the chairs.. overall a good experience!\n",

Plus great Hygiene condition maintained by the kitchen staff.I have been here for breakfast and had English paneer tikka sandwich and iced latte.

      "The service was the worst.. All of my friends went to the dance floor and I was stopped by the staff who asked not to leave the table and asked me to deposit my id card.

We have ordered Paneer Majestic nothing extraordinary about it was good. Later we have tried Bhami Goreng, Veg Kolhapuri, Butter Naan and Murg Biryani. Bhami Goreng had very unique different flavour/taste which I liked. Same thing with the curry and naan both of them were really good. Special mention to Murg Biryani it was amazing.\n",

We ordered for some starters from which we really like Bakchoy fry and also Malai Broccoli, chilli potato and Red chilli chicken were really nice and if you like to have some soup I would definitely suggest hi for Broccoli soup. For the Main course we ordered some White sauce pasta, Grilled chicken with Lemon Butter Garlic Sauce, Vegetarian Fried rice and my favorite Pork Spare Ribs which was just Scrumptious and beautifully cooked pork. We also ordered a cheese platter with wine and I would suggest this for the people who love to enjoy and cheese and wine.\n",

      "₹269/-\n",
      "It was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ❤️❤️\n",
      "It comprises of the following:\n",
      "▪️Kadai Paneer (4.5/5)\n",
      "Paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! But, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravy👍👍\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Dum aloo (4/5)\n",
      "This was the veg of the day, potatoes 🥔 were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! Just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Dal Makhani (4.5/5)\n",
      "A Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani!!! It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Bundi Raita (5/5)\n",
      "This one stole my heart ❣ I think words won’t do justice for its great taste!! I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot!!! I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish 👍👍👍\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Rice (4/5)\n",
      "The zeera basmati rice 🍚 was definitely of the best quality!! It was big in size and was cooked so well!! Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Butter Tandoori Roti (4/5)\n",
      "It was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat 🌾 without any hint of maida!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Salad (4.5/5)\n",
      "Fresh cucumber 🥒, carrot 🥕 and onion with a pinch of lemon 🍋 is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali 👍👍\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Kheer (4/5)\n",
      "The perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!\n",
      ".\n",
      ".\n",
      "⚫️ The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!\n",
      "The quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! But, I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!\n",

      "I dont know much about gachibowli branch, but banjara hills branch has the worst costumer service that I have ever seen in my life..! Very ill professional employees who cannot guide their costumers properly to their place. They have great quality in what they serve but zero in how they serve. My whole party got ruined because of their so called great service. I have given a bulk order and asked if they have home delivery, ofcourse there was none. I was okay with it and said I will collect it from their store. I almost travelled 20 km from my place to collect my @ order and due to heavy traffic, I reached the place exactly 5 min late from their closing time. I kept giving them information about how far I am and that I would reach them in less time. I requested them to wait for 5 minutes as I was travelling from habsiguda which is atleast 20km away from banjara hills. They answered my call at 9:00 when I was near GVKONE. I said I will come in 5 min they said they will wait. But, by the time I reach their place everything was locked. I called them 100 times and their was no response. What an awful service..! If you have a big party, please don't rely and order anything from this place. Worst experience..!\n",
      "Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)\n",
      "This place has a good ambience. However, the food is not up to the mark. The staff usually takes a lot of time to bring the food which is also not mouth-watering. Undoubtedly, Gal Punjab Di can improve.\n",
      "Food was really nice...it was just traditional touch of.punjab...since I am punajabi ,so the taste.. especially rasile rajmah... Management could work on more with ambiance n services amenities. For food 5star\n",
      "Best place to have biryani in and around Gachibowli.Definitely recommendable. Almost fully crowded on weekends and weekdays both because of the quality and quantity.\n",
      "Went for my birthday dinner on Friday night here with my wife\n",
      "Ambience is good. But food is very ordinary.\n",
      "We ordered only 2 items, fish and chips, and sea bass fillet with vegetables. Both of them were not fresh.\n",
      "Service was not stand out either.\n",
      "Overall a very meh experience.\n",
      "Ordered Afghani nuts ice-cream; gotta say the quantity was more than what I expected and the amount of nuts/dry-fruits was generous. Ice cream was smooth and tasty. Would definitely order again!\n",
      "Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit:\n",
      "Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).\n",
      "It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will keep ordering from Amul ! :)\n",
      "Every foodie I met in Hyderabad recommended this Shawarma. I had just started loving the one from Istah's, but I'm up for a new challenge. My friend ordered one and we shared. It was awesome. It was spicy and tasty. Then, I ordered one myself, but I ordered the one with salad. What a slap in the face. I came with cucumbers and almonds (what?). The rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle. Nevertheless, I liked the Shawarma. It's not the best, but it's in the high ranks.\n",
      "Edit 1: Yesterday I went to Shah Ghouse again. I really wanted to try the special Shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion. To be honest, I was blown. It's the best Shawarma I've ever had. The meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much. I relished every single bite. Take a bow, Shah Ghouse!\n",
      "Very good place for casual dinners. Starters are good and main course was also having good spread and taste as well. Deserts are really very tasty especially sweets.\n",
      "Very good food.. had a great time at Bdubs. We specially enjoyed the buffalo ranch chicken burger.. yummy it is. And the roller coaster ride with Virtual reality is a great experience for the first timers.Thanks Adil :)\n",
      "Response from hotel is “khaana hi to kha nai to ja” AC doest work in summer and even server behaves as if hez the owner of hotel. Doesn’t recommend for dine in here.\n",
      "Awesome place with great taste . You can taste desi along with continental foods. Nachos and pizza are must try. Sizzle rs were awesome. Desserts are tasty. Ambiance is great you might find prices a bit high but the taste worth’s it\n",
      "missing cutlery\n",
      "The Paneer curry & Jeera rice was super awesome. I still cannot forget the taste. Thanks for the treat. Veggie folks do visit the restaurant.\n",
      "I had a food session here. The service was very nice and food was nice too. They have this two amazing varieties of soups, Arabianchicken soup and lemon coriander soup, which were amazing. Dragon Chicken and Hariyali fish is a must try. Chiken pahadi was good as well. They have two varieties of Mandi, fish fried mandi and chicken grilled Mandi, the presentation was excellent. I’m in love with the chicken Mandi here. They have a variety of milkshakes and deserts. Kaddu ki kheer was delicious . Lovely place and the ambiance is beautiful aswell.\n",

      "Ordered Non Veg Mini Thali through Swiggy. Delivery was quick and packaging was perfect.\n",
      "It had Dal Makhani, Chicken Curry, Raita, Rice and Tandoori Roti, Dal Makhani was good and rest all items were just average. Tandoori rotis were hard, didn't like it.\n",

      "Have been to this place on sunday. The starters Jawalamukhi tikka and chilly paneer was very delicious and paneer was so soft that it jst melted in mouth. In Main course paneer lababdar tasted little sweet and lacha partha was not worth. Anyways jeera rice and dal tadka was like authentic punjabi taste.\n",
      "Ambience was good but it was too noisy.\n",
      "Overall the experience was great.\n",

My friend and I come here once in a while to catch up and we just love this Cafe. It's so cute, quiet, and very pretty. I love the theme. I'm not really sure how the food is. We've had their Mawa cake which goes great with the Chai and the paneer sub which wasn't that great. But nonetheless, it's one of my favorite places.\n",

      "very good service\n",
      "On my visit at a pleasant evening to the restaurant I ordered Cosmopolitan drink. While my friends beer came right away, they took almost an hour to get my drink. After that day, I got some infection in my throat which I ignored for few days and it got worse. The doctor at Apollo told me that it’s a severe bacterial infection and I had to take antibiotic injection twice along with other medication followed by various tests. Although everything about the restaurant was nice but not sure what went wrong with that drink in particular which ended me in a hospital!\n",

      "\n",
      "I was wanting to order from here once for that taste of Maggi. Who doesn't like a fancy maggi noodles? So one fine night, ordered for a Corn Masala Cheese Butter Maggi through Zomato.  That was the most fanciest name I could find on their menu. \n",
      "\n",
      "The delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork. The maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which I am not that big a fan of. It could have been a bit drier. But the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter & cheese in the maggi.  Good cost effective outlet for the love of Maggi Noodles.\n"

All the vegetarians out there should try that..loved their crispy corn,chilli paneer ,lemon coriander soup.. rather I would say u order anything under the sun there and u would love it. That's how surreal has been my experience so far..\n",

The only complain about this place is the playlist,(more of old and sad bollywood songs) it was so loud and it totally is a huge off.I suggest please change the playlist guys,it's ruining the whole vibe of the place,this is the first time i had to bear music instead of enjoying it.Anyways,i liked the unexpected visit to this place.\n",

      "We have brought cakes from labonel jubilee hills many times and it has always been great. On Christmas we tried labonel Gachibowli plum cake. The cake was very good and the dried fruits were of very good quality. Totally enjoyed the cake.\n",
      "The rooftop of the place is quite good. But, only drawback is that the place is small. Thus, it was overcrowded and there was little place to move.\n",
      "Liked the food it's was good but not anything special or memorable, good service but I do not appreciate how the waiters pestered me into writing a review. No wonder this place a high rating staff will keep bugging you till you write a good review\n",
      "Veg wraps are amezing tasty!\n",
      "This place was recommended by people for some good Haleem, and that's the reason we paid this place a visit. We ordered two dishes of Haleem and two full plates and one regular plate of Chicken Biryani.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Haleem was very well prepared and had the aroma and taste. It was delicious! The servings of Biryani was overwhelming and very filling. The regular serving was more than one normal person could eat. But the taste was average and nothing new. The chicken was cooked well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ambience was good but a little too full. There's no default seating for groups of more than four people, and as we were a group of five, we had to rearrange a few chairs. The service was prompt but, understandably, very busy.\n",
      "The taste was not yet good,it's was too oil in biryani and while we are asking to the manager he said that it was ghee,no proper response from them.\n",
      "Excellent service and food buffet! This place has really warm service and they are always willing to customise the menu since it becomes repetitive otherwise. The pocket pinch is slightly higher, but it's totally worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then best starters are Cajun potato, crispy corn, mushrooms, dahi kebabs, corn tikki. All the starters are lip-smacking. Make sure to keep room for the main course.\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't tried many options from the main course, though, dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to desserts, gal Jamuns are literally out of the world. Try them with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. You wouldn't want to eat them anywhere else! Alongside, pan kulfi is a must try. 😍😬 there are a plenty of other desserts to choose from.\n",

      "I ordered the Cafe Frappe. It was super diluted (read 'water' ) and tasteless! Such a disappointment!\n",
      "The snack items are nice. The pasta here is good. I have also tried the cupcakes which were also good just a bit too sweet. The ambience is very good and there is sofa seating available too.\n",
      "not so good test\n",
      "The DJ that came on around 11 PM yesterday night (some lady) was a terrific disimprovement over the guy who was playing right before she. Killed the buzz for us entirely (and for many others, too, visibly). Liked the ambience, though. Would want to visit again iff the same DJ never presents themselves again.\n",
      "Its a big mistake if ever u plan to have your food here. We have ordered for Veg Pasta & we have been served with Chicken Pasta. We have waited for an hour just for Broccoli and left without having our food.\n",
      "Vada, Poha both were not good.... not cooked well. Tetrapack juice as chosen was not given. Food was not great.\n",
      "Noodles packet was having too much oil, it poured around 50-100ml oil.. too bad\n",
      "Fried rice was taste less\n",
      "Great taste and quick deliverey\n",
      "I have had high expectations of food there but then my green salad with mint sauce was not very good. While the chicken wings I ordered were nice, but they ruined the American Chopsuey. It was more like eating a soupy noodles than a Chopsuey. I wish they would have made that better.\n",
      "Ambience was good, staff were okay.\n",
      "I liked the food very much. The best part is the ambience of it, you cannot ask for a better one in Hyderabad. It is so peaceful and one could spend hours sitting there. We had a hard time finding parking spot as the parking is full. Other than that, I loved this place and would go there again and again!\n",
      "he asked me to give rating.\n",
      "Visited this place on ramadan and we ordered 6 haleem we where 4 all we thought that we can enjoy the real taste of haleem and the bitter truth was the taste was long gone with the moving season .. seriously there is something wrong with this branch too many uncooked bones and intestines . All I can just say is ONE BAD TASTE IS ENOUGH to make all the good once bad ..\n",
      "Had tried Chicken Shawarma, Lukmi, Samosa, Veg Puff, Egg and Chicken Puff.\n",
      "Chicken Shawarma, was expecting the taste to be lot better but it was just ok. It tasted bland and mayonnaise was also not upto to the mark. Overall Didn't meet my expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Lukmi and samosa were same in taste and preparation, just the shape was different. Better to go for samosa instead of Lukmi, the taste was ok though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comming to the Puffs, all were pretty average just like you would get in any other random bakery. Not a big fan of these.\n",

      "1. Garlic Fried rice - good\n",
      "2. Mixed veggies in schezwan sauce - good\n",
      "3. Mixed mushroom platter - did not please my taste buds. Left half the dish. I am not a fan of any mushroom other than the button mushroom. Even if I liked other mushrooms, I wouldn't have liked this dish. It's nothing special. Tasted like simple sauted mushrooms.\n",
      "4. Showstopper - Yin Yan soup. Half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste. The other half of it had thick coriander soup. I think this is what they serve full bowl as lemon coriander soup. Fan of this. Coming back for this soup.\n",
      "Ordered cheese corn maggi and veg cheese maggi for 100 rupees and review is based on that.\n",
      "Quality: 5/5: The maggi was neither too soupy nor thick it was perfect with good taste\n",

      "Packaging : 5/5\n",
      "worst quality and taste for chat\n",
      "We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday given the ratings we saw. However the restaurant did not live up to the high expectations, considering the average food and slow service. The staff was courteous though as we did not like our tomato soup, and they were prompt enough to take it back. Honestly, the replaced one wasn't much of a relief either. Would recommend there to go for the evening view with friends for few drinks, but don't expect mu h beyond that!\n",
      "It is a good restaurant for Chinese food in Gachibowli.we did order food and starters from here and loved the quality and quantity. The staff were all friendly n ambience was decent. Only problem was that their card swipe machine was not working.but overall a good experience in Hyderabad n will visit again to have Chinese food in the landof biriyani.\n",
      "not bad\n",
      "Food is worth the hype! Expect a crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a Chicken Dum Pulao and it was the best thing I ate in my 6 days stay at Hyderabad! Everything was properly cooked and tasted delicious. Though a little expensive, they were worth it. There were ample pieces of chicken.\n",
      "Only things I’d complain about would be Pudina Chutney and the quantity of rice.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is located on the 3rd floor of a mall (SLN Terminus), and you will have to dine in the common food court. Good food and the close proximity to IT companies attract a crowd. You can order online to avoid the rush.\n",
      "I ordered a mutton seekh kebab and a chicken biryani. The kebab was ok ~ 3/5 but the chicken biryani was really bad ~ 1/5. I never waste food. If there is excess, I parcel it but this biryani I just have to leave it and come. Even the chicken pieces are not at all tasty.\n",
      "The ambiance is average , there are different types of seatings and they had pleasant lighting.\n",
      "Overall 2/5.\n",
      "A very active and courteous staff. Shaqeel was really helpful and on his toes to cater to us the whole time. The ambience was great. A great variety in the grill items however the deserts could have been a little less sweeter. The dishes well liked were crispy corn, green apple fox, and angoori gulab jamun. Ice creams and custard lacked their respective flavours which was a disappointment. Surely would like to visit again expecting the above changes are made. :)\n",
      "Don't have zero rate here, one I m giving bcoz they welcomed me nice way, but food was sucks here, we had three starters which were not good at all, chicken starter was smelling may be they use stock or stale chic. Not come again here, very bad experience. Total wasting of money .\n",
      "😡😡\n",
      "Food was stale when ordered through swiggy pop. Rita salad everything was smelling stale had to order again and discard this food. Please send proper food through swiggy pop\n",

They we're serving what they deemed fit for us and not as per our order. Chicken lababdar was wanting in taste, fennel seeds were used and curry was as thin as a soup , no one was nearby when serving were required. Service is what we look forward to when dining in your restaurant.Either there was change in chef or some other temporary issues. Hope it would be fixed soon and we will not be disappointed when dining next time with our friends.\n",

Place was full by the time we reached but the staff managed to give us the seating at nxt floor.Ordered half portion of mutton juicy mandi with extra piece, bbq chicken mandi and full veg mandi (😑). Loved the mutton mandi which is served with marag soup and other two gravies, mutton was soft, tender and juicy and bbq chicken was perfectly marinated and grilled.Staff needs an improvement on their service.Manager was kind enough to give us corporate discount when asked.Overall good taste of food and good place with nice relaxed ambience of arabian restaurant within that area.\n",

      "Food is great here. Surprisingly even veg food was good. we ordered variety of veg and non veg starters and food was simply awesome. Their staff is very coordial too. Live music and the goa feel adds to lot of fun. I believe the photographs talks itself for amazing ambience they have to offer.\n",
      "Food and ambience is average, waiter is not serving the food properly, we need to keep asking him to bring salads, chutneys and all, finally he demanded particular amount tip while paying the bill.\n",
      "name was written from history, on the cake😑\n",
      "Whenever you get the urge to eat hygienic food with less calories this the place to order from. It offers a wide variety of dishes ranging from Indian, Continental, Oriental and even Caribbean. The food is prepared in a way that it is healthy, but doesn’t compromise on taste. Also, the dishes are reasonably priced. My only issue is that many dishes go out of stock very quickly.\n",
      "The food was ❤️.. We ordered banjara tangdi for starter which was the best among all.. Papiya Shuvro was well mannered and her service was best among all.\n",
      "I did not have a good experience here. The service wasn't good. The ice cream looked good, but I didn't like the taste. Too many nuts. The listing in the menu was a bit misleading, and didn't have anything mentioned about nuts.\n",
      "I read about this place in best shawarmas listing in Google. And Ordered peri peri chicken shawarma. It's average because i regularly eat shah ghouse one's. For sure, shah ghouse is a lot better than this. And there is no reason to prefer this over that.\n",

      "And for the coke drink they took 60rs for a 20rs bottle. Seriously?\n",
      "good\n",
      "The manager named Siddarth was treating us very badly. We went with a few girls. The other guys around were teasing our friends. When we asked him he said he can't do anything. He does not have minimum courtesy to talk politely with the customers. The staff lack basic professionalism. One of my worst experiences.\n",
      "The service is awesome. The Josh is high.\n",
      "Loud music and dance floor , what else can we expect. Pavan took a great care of us with his pleasent hospitality. We had a Rocking party\n",

      "Great\n",
      "Actually I struggled between 3 and 4 for this place, where drinks are so good and buffet doesn't last to it. But a totally classy atmosphere in buffet area and very good vibes in first floor and their brewery is one of the best. A little costly. Caution: if you are a stag majority of times they won't allow u on ground floor in evenings, which is kind of sucks though. Finally value for money for a date or with a team else little expensive\n",
      "I had a real craving for a chocolate and ordered Death by Chocolate cake and Quadruple Swiss Chocolate Cookie.\n",
      "Cookie was pretty awesome and would definitely recommend trying(though it's pretty small) . Death by Chocolate cake was not fresh, and had that sugary texture to it. It was really disappointing.\n",
      "Awesome food.. But services degraded compared to last year... Will come next time for sure... But expecting thing better than this... Thank you\n",
      "Food was worst and it came with a strong smell of oil. Chilly garlic noodle did not have any garlic, not even the flavour. All the items were really not eatable.\n",
      "I quite like the sumptuous North Indian and South Indian vegetarian thalis at this place. Served hot. Reasonably priced. Not too fond of ala carte here, though I must add it is still better than a lot of places. The ambience and simple aesthetics of the place make it a great place for Sunday lunch with family.\n",
      "Had been to this place for a lunch. Decent place - had a South Indian thali. Food is okay - but can be a better in terms of taste. Decent ambience & Service. But something is a miss here🤔\n",
      "good delivery\n",
      "good\n",
      "The staffs are very Friendly and polite... This is one of the best Chinese restaurant in Hyderabad, i suggest this place to all the people who love authentic oriental cuisine.\n",
      "Service is very slow. We waited for 30 min for the non veg starter and ended up having lots of time soda and left.. the dishes had very least salt. The chat was bitter.\n",
      "Lime soda missing\n",
      "Oh what a lovely place. Thanks to my friend who took me here for breakfast. Both of us were super hungry. We ordered mushroom omelette with butter crossiant and scarmbled egg with butter crossiant. A jalepeno bagel with cream chees. OMG 😲 what amazing they tasted. The best crossiant I have come across so far in India. So soft. So were the scrambles egg and mushroom omlette. The cream cheese was just amazing. We ordered Hazelnut cafe Mocha and Hazelnut capcuinno. They were just good. Thank go hazelnut syrup they used wasnt very sweet.\n",
      "I was so in love with smell of bread they are baking took. banana cake , Danish pastry , Chocolate cake and brioche for my frined. Would definitely recommend if you love bread that too freshly baked. 😋\n",
      "I usually don't eat fish. But I tried Amritsari fish tikka here. Tasted good. And in main course, quantity of the curry served is less.\n",
      "Overall experience - 4\n",

      "Dint like at all . The pizza was good and loaded with cheese and veggies.\n",
      "Service : Its bad - really bad .. Might be the only reason i would not want to go again .\n",
      "There are some great reviews about this place - but my experience was not nice at all. So dissapointed\n",
      "+1 is for the ambience\n",

      "We had ordered 3 non veg starters and 3 veg starters. There weren’t many good options for veg starters and something veg that we ordered were just average at taste. And moreover that day there were only starters and main course was not available. When it comes to music this was the best part. The day we visited there was bhangra music. Apart form Bhangra the dj was good was playing mostly bollywood music. Overall if you want good bollywood music with not so great food you can surely try this place\n",
      "Food is incredible. I have visited several times but still the menu has lot of items to cover. The staff is very friendly and Shravan Kumar is very much good at his service and also in ambience. A must visit place.\n",
      "Spicy chicken Sizzler with noodles is ultimate here.\n",
      "Food taste better here. The food servicing is not that much good. The food preparation time is bit high. If you have patience to wait then you can give a try for it.\n",
      "I have been there multiple times and have ordered food at home as well.... 13 Dhaba has never let me down.. i love aloo parantha.. paneer tikka is mind blowing.. lassi is perfect.. chole bhature is osum... poori sabzi, rajma gobhi ka paranthe.. list is endless.. i have tried out everything there... even i loved aloo ki sabzi and kachori.. but its no longer continued.. the place has been renovated and its nice to be there and have the real taste of punjab.... i make sure m there often... 13 Dhaba rocks and i love their hospitality... these people never deny you for anything (like extra pyaaz, achaar or raita)which makes it more friendly and comfortable.... one can pay for these extra little things but the way they show generosity in serving these asks without a frown for money, make them very very friendly and makes people to go there more.. u ppl rock!!!\n",

      "Definite recommendation.\n",
      "I had gone for lunch a few days back and no doubt the place and food is amazing but I was not given the dessert which was included in the platter and the staff is always looking at you while you're eating, until you finish.\n",
      "2 stars for food and ambience respectively but for the service they provide, I'm not at all happy with the place.\n",
      "I had lunch in absolute sizzler it was an amazing experience great food n great staff with friendly atmosphere , special thanks to Srinivas Rao for his personalized service. We will come back again\n",
      "Late review. Ambiance is good(theme : ancient India with various stuffs). I forget the name of the dishes and mocktails (most probably 1 chicken and 1 mutton dishes (main course)). Main course was good. I preferred chicken dish.\n",

      "chicken was not boiled\n",
      "Mandi seema lovely items. Should definitely try it. But item should be hot 🔥 to better its taste. Service in the restaurant were not that good for the family orientated people there will be late what ever you try\n",

      "I will definitely try other dishes here.\n",
      "Explored this place today and was surprisingly very good because it never occurred me to try out for this long. Has an American cafe ambiance and feel and is open until 1 AM at least. The cheese garlic bread, veg puffs and Latte coffee were pretty good. It's self service and the order came in pretty quick. One and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness. Overall, a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite. Amit Agrawal Harsh Jhunjhunwala Poorvi Agarwal\n",
      "I specially mentioned in message to fry that scrambled eggs properly till crispy brown but they gave it as it is. it wasnt cooked properly.\n",

      "I ordered mutton biryani and it was very bad..Worst quality mutton biryani you can eat . The pieces were all leftovers small bits and it felt he gave all leftover . On telling him to replace...reataurant told let them check it ...But then nothing was replaced . One should not prefer this restaurant as quality is now degraded . Extremely bad and horrible service .\n",
      "My absolute go-to- place! This place is a blessing for me since it serves amazing coffee. Also absolutely near to my office so I can hop in whenever I want.\n",
      "Ambience: Love it! Not too fancy Not too boring. Just about right !\n",
      "Food and Coffee: LOOOOVEEE it! Everything you eat there is absolutely fresh! I just love the donuts, sandwiches and the coffee! I have tried almost everything on their menu and I guarantee that nothing will disappoint you.\n",
      "Must try: Egg Salad Sandwich in Focaccia bread ❤️ any coffee and the Nutella Brioche\n",
      "Price: Affordable with a guaranteed smile when you leave\n",
      "Service: Amazing staff!\n",
      "The experience here was so good. The managing staff were really polite to every single person. the food was wayyy too good and the ambience was beautiful too. Had a lovely experience.\n",
      "I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store. There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.\n",
      "It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company.\n",
      "We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !\n",
      "One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !\n",
      "\n",
      "We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !\n",
      "They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Crabmeat Soup- This soup was thick with minced crab meat. The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.\n",
      "2. Corn Cubes - A must try out platter. The dish was innovative. The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.\n",
      "3. Chicken Yakitori- I did not like this preparation. It was very dull and tasteless. There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main Course -\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Manchow Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dessert\n",
      "1. Bangkok Custurd- I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! It tasted like Firni. As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. It was just yum for the greedy tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total- Rs. 1396 ( Inclusive of taxes )\n",
      "\n",
      "Cobclusion - The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. No coordination among the staffs. Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions. Its just okayish for casual dinner/ lunch. I will think twice to visit this place again.\n",
      "I had pretty \"authentic\" Chinese food here. Along with chilli sauce and chicken pieces in noodles, they served few insects as well. Staff is also quite cool and composed. Even after showing it to them, he just walked away with the bowl and didn't even bothered to say sorry. Respect!!\n",
      "The ambience of the club is really nice. The staff are friendly and the best thing about Club rouge is the pricing, it is budget friendly for food and liquor.\n",
      "The food is really good and waiter Narender is very enthusiastic with his work. Ambience is just ok and starters are awesome. Main course is just ok and deserts are available with different varieties. 5star rating for Narendra for his work and service.\n",
      "This is the place you should be, if you are treating your friends full meals without burning your pocket.. Everything we ordered was tasty and good quantity..\n",
      "If you love to get lost in music and enjoy a real good ambience, then my friend Tiki Shack is your place. Staff is quite food. I used my Zomato Gold membership there and enjoyed 2+2 on drinks. Food was delicious too. I would love to spend more such evenings there.\n",
      "Food wasn't up to the expectation. Friendly staff, the ambience was really good. Live music was very soothing. Would definitely visit again. Overall, thumbs up for replicating goa experience.\n",
      "Good food ...............\n",
      "But can you add some more spicy because ur items was not spicy... Like a paneer and chicken curry other wise everything was good.\n",
      "And service was good.....................................................\n",
      "Crazy place guys....very small and middle of non residential area and top of a residential place.\n",
      "DJ with IPL...it was crazy, I was there with my boss, he loved it but it's bit crowded.\n",
      "Limited IMFLs and staff was good and humble.\n",
      "My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.\n",
      "They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.\n",
      "The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits\n",
      "\n",
      "Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ❤️ - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.\n",
      "Veg Lasagna ❤️ - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.\n",
      "Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.\n",
      "Makhmali Paneer Tikka -\n",
      "Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler\n",
      "Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.\n",
      "Cheese and Cheese Pizza ❤️ - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!\n",
      "In name of offer on Uber Eats, this restaurant is cheating with customers, using third class quality rice for biryani and no meat at all in mutton biryani, not even single piece, atleast rice should be good, that also full masala and full oily. Will complain to food inspection officials of GHMC, customers will get diseases by eating such kind of full masala biryani and low quality rice\n",
      "Had a nice evening there yesterday. Food was decent. Biryani was good but little dry. Need to improve little more. Ambience was good. Staffs are friendly\n",
      "Big fan of the wings . Service is great , big screen game viewing with stadium sound .Standard selection beers !of Sandeep at the bar was excellent . !\n",
      "This is opened up in SLN terminals and visitied during lunch time, its a shop in a food court so no ambience as such.\n",
      "Their paneer combo is a must try, dal makhani was really good. Another thing we had was amritsari kulcha with chole - kulcha was good but chole can be made better. overall a must go to place for the northside taste.\n",
      "The place is cool and the person who served us (Sahoo) is too good. Nice place to visit again and chill out. Nice place to hang out with friends\n",
      "Coming to the tast. It was above average can't say the best. But tastes good enough.\n",
      "But when it comes to serving, the boys are very slow need to improve\n",
      "Good food and the service of quality are very good and the ambiance and hospitality are amazing t I really enjoyed the food Judi busy bug birth Nick\n",
      "This place was there in my bucket list for quite a long time. It was worth being there. The space is quite good and the service too. Good experience.\n",
      "Ordered pancake breakfast combo, quality and packing of food is really good, one of the best English breakfast for reasonable cost, Delivery was also quick.\n",
      "I ordered chicken biryani online.. Zomato delivered it ontime but food quality was very bad.. Honestly I doubt whether they are serving chicken or some other meat.. I had to thrown the biryani that they delivered.. Very bad restaurant that I felt.\n",
      "rice not baked properly\n",
      "First of all the ambience was just breathtaking, there was around the pool, I really like pool side sitting arrangement and light soothing music , very quiet place . Best for couples\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was great and quick . The staff was very polite and humble . I really like the way they treat customers . You will definitely get a VIP like treatment there 😉 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the food , we ordered chicken tikka, paneer makhani and naan . All the three dishes was great . Perfect combination of all spices neither too much nor too less , just the Right amount of spices and other stuffs.\n",
      "In drinks we ordered LIIT (Long island ice tea) and minty mango , drinks was also good.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was bit expensive but worth paying money.\n",
      "good\n",
      "They sever a good variety of bread and other baking products but only selected items are good. The must try items are brownies, chocochip cookies, banana bread, sandwiches, pizza etc. They sever few items which don’t really have any purpose but just to attract kids(eg: Nutella Brioche), these kind of items might dissatisfy people.\n",
      "Quantity is very less, from the last two months i have given 3 big orders at that time both quality and quantity is good based on that i have order today again, but now it is disappointed. I am not going to order again\n",
      "I visit skyhy on monday . I drink Martin's cocktail it was very good.. Service is good..Food also good ..Superb DJ....This place is totally wonderful...\n",
      "Very good service , went with my kids in Saturday night amazing experience , paneer was really up to the mark ... Service led by Mr tapan who served us was amazing ... Definitely worth another visit...\n",
      "American choupsey gravy was a bit sweet then it has to be\n",
      "Awesome place one of the best places in hyderabar... Girish was awesome he made sure we had great time....the dj was the best ive seen in hderabad\n",
      "Food is good, but for the second time around they didn't send us our complete order. Had ordered 4 Naans, got only 2. Also got Daal Tadka instead of Daal Makhani. Not sure if its the Ramadaan rush, but now twice in a row our online orders thru Zomato have been messed up. Probably will avoid going forward.\n",
      "Well to start of with I was there for Nucleya event. The place is just awesome and in Hyderabad at first it was hard to find a proper club. And then prism happened. Great team who managed more than 3k people that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambience - 5/5.\n",
      "Food - 4/5.\n",
      "Service- 4/5.\n",
      "Menu - 4/5.\n",

      "A must visit place if you want to really enjoy clubbing.\n",
      "delivery good\n",
      "I had very high expectations from This one. But disappointed. Talking about food , the taste was below average. We ordered Pasta and pizzas both were not at all good. The only thing which i liked about this place is the Ambience. It's very decent. Coming to service, the waiters were very humble but our order took more than 1 hour to reach us to the table. Overall Below average experience . 😐\n",
      "So unprofessional place being a girl I felt the staff was inappropriate on behaviour and I love the Dj anyways over there but the staff is making the place worst so freaking rude\n",
      "Been here on a Saturday evening. The service looked a bit slow but the food tasted good. They allow stags without any cover charge but they don’t let you enter the dance floor if you’re one. The staff is also very co-operative. Go here as a crowd and you would love it.\n",
      "everything one needs. Seating at Fully friendly bar man ..sillu.....? Thank u for your service n drink\n",
      "\n",
      "biggest place gachiwali area n quality of food was delicious we really testy and service is very fast➕ . Overall 5 to 5 we definitely recommende.?......?.......\n",
      "The ambience is excellent , the food not so much , we ordered a half n half pizza , margarita & bbq chicken , the pizza was not up to the mark , now for the second dish we had ordered was Alfredo Chicken Pasta , the pasta sauce was very liquidish , chicken was undercooked. I am have visited this restaurant before & it was an awesome experience , we used Zomato good during this visit of ours , not sure if this has anything to do with the food taste , there were 2 pizza slices left & the the restaurant said they will not pack the leftover food as they said it was orders / rules from zomato , they said they would rather throw the left over in the dustbin but not give it to the customer , this is very strange rules , zomato relook at your guidelines\n",
      "I am giving 3 star out of 5 to mustang just for roof top ambience where i was able to drink in between the glowing city lights ... Restaurant should work on customer service more ...\n",
      "Ordered pasta and taste was not at all good\n",
      "Absolutely stunning! From their customer service, ambience to food! From the get go, The Manager Nitin was helpful and assisted me in organizing an awesome Couple Shower for my Sis and her Partner! They let us have the best spot by the pool, let us decorate, served us entree at the table and set up speakers for us play our own music! Their service was impeccable through out that night. Thanks Mazzo & Nitin for helping me to make it memorable for my sis and her now husband!\n",

      "Just look at those happy smiles!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers and keep up the stellar service!\n",
      "Alice\n",
      "Yesterday I was here with my two friends, it was raining and weather was amazing. The best fusion food I could ever eat. It's a must go place guys, I would rather say best place for romantic couples, good view, ambience of the restaurant, good yummy yummy food and silent music. The manager and people who were serving here are so polite and humble to suggest food and drinks. I would like to visit again soon.\n",
      "😍😍😍\n",
      "Egg Salad and Cappuccino were good!\n",
      "Chilli Garlic Cheese Toast could have more of cheese and spice added to it!\n",
      "Brownie Shake required a lot of improvements!\n",
      "Not that great place!\n",
      "Vada didn’t getfry inside... everything else good\n",
      "order 2 allo parotha got only one\n",
      "So I’ve been to this place with a couple of friends for breakfast, so I’d say that their bakery items are out of the world. Freshly baked and you can see the chefs preparing them through a transparent glass.\n",
      "Breakfast wasn’t great, would give it a 2/5\n",
      "They use their own recipes and sauces.\n",
      "Also, most importantly it’s a big hole to your pocket. Very expensive. So watch out\n",
      "We had an awesome experience. Govind ( Dola Govind) was so polite, friendly and kept on bringing us lots of tasty dishes till we could eat no more!!! Great job all of you.\n",
      "Rudest billing staff ever. Didn't provide change. Worst customer service. Never going again. Don't know how to treat the customers. Many options available.\n",
      "Order through Zomato. I ordered Egg noodles with chicken 65 meal box for lunch and relished it thoroughly. I ordered Veg fried rice with chicken 65 meal box for dinner on same day. This was also pretty tasty. I have ordered medium size for lunch and the quantity was a fad bit more for one person., however small size box was apt for a single person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would love to order many more times from this place.\n",
      "Amazing food.... Anyone who wants to have delicious finger licking Punjabi food, must visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this place they are like an outlet rather than a restaurant so it might feel a bit uncomfortable but there food will make you forget all complaints.\n",
      "Driven cafe comes with a perfect ambience that entices any motor head. The themed cafe has a number of exotic cars and bikes that one can choose from to rent. The wide range of beverages and the quirky bites that Driven cafe has to offer, make it a must go place!\n",
      "Ok ok\n",
      "good\n",
      "it was an awesome experience.....the staff specially Nitish was really kind and attentive, food and beverage was really nice, thanks for the great experience....\n"
